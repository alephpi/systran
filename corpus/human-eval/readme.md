Here are five files we expect you to evaluate, there are 739 sentences, don't worry we are not asking you to evaluate them all. That's why we provide this readme file.

The five files are self-explained by their name.

Basically we want you to focus on the reduction of word repetition in three pairs:

1. best-hypothesis-by-penalization-on-inference.fr vs baseline-hypothesis.fr
2. best-hypothesis-by-penalization-on-training.fr vs baseline-hypothesis.fr
3. best-hypothesis-by-penalization-on-training.fr vs best-hypothesis-by-penalization-on-inference.fr

We expect that in both 1 and 2 the repetition is suppressed
We hope for 3 the penalization on training performs better than penalization on inference but we are not sure.
