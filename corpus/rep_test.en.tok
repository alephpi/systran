This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop ￭.
The H￭ ang Sen￭ g Inde￭ x of the Hong Kong Sto￭ ck Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day ￭, but later it er￭ ased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2 ￭.￭ 5 percent ￭.
The H￭ ang Sen￭ g China Enter￭ prises Inde￭ x ￭, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong ￭, dropped by 3 ￭.￭ 8 percent ￭, in Shanghai the markets were closed ￭.
Despite the fact that it is a part of China ￭, Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately ￭, that is ￭, without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank ￭.
On Monday the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system ￭, into which up to 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion dollars (￭ nearly 1￭ 2 billion Czech crow￭ ns ￭) was to be invested ￭.
American stocks suffered a blood￭ b￭ ath on Monday and the major stock ind￭ exes registered their greatest fall in more than 2￭ 0 years ￭.
The index had dropped even prior to the vote ￭, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House ￭, the index went into free fall ￭.
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W ￭. Bush ￭'￭ s cabinet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system ￭.
American legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amounting to 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion dollars (￭ approximately 1￭ 2 billion crow￭ ns ￭) ￭.
In the meantime ￭, however ￭, it is not yet clear with any certainty when both cham￭ bers of the American Congress will vote on the bill ￭, nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem ￭.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount ￭, in the se￭ quence of a further 1￭ 0￭ 0 billion dollars and later ￭, the final 3￭ 5￭ 0 billion dollars ￭, if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function ￭.
Though the president can veto this decision ￭, Congress can over￭ ride his veto ￭.
Even in spite of these changes ￭, the essential idea of the program ￭, to gain finances for the bu￭ y￭ out of bad mortgage stocks ￭, the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages ￭, has remained intact ￭.
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee ￭, Christ￭ op￭ her Dodd ￭, the chief negoti￭ ator ￭, said that the legislators had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program ￭, protection of the taxpayers against losses ￭, closing of relief packages ￭, and timing of the financial plan ￭.
The cabinet should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it bu￭ ys ￭, with the aim of lowering the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses ￭.
According to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in Austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a significant boost for the right ￭-￭ wing populist parties ￭.
According to the preliminary results ￭, the Social Democratic Party (￭ SP￭ Ö ￭) remains the strongest in the country with 2￭ 9 ￭.￭ 8 percent of votes ￭, however ￭, it has lost 5 ￭.￭ 5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 6 ￭.
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post ￭-￭ war history ￭, and particularly for the People ￭'￭ s Party ￭, who urged the early elections ￭, it is literally a catastrophic result ￭.
Such a development would certainly simplify the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results ￭, that is ￭, the renewal of the large coalition of SP￭ Ö and Ö￭ V￭ P ￭.
Given the strengthening of both right ￭-￭ wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (￭ F￭ P￭ Ö ￭) gained a preliminary 1￭ 8 percent and B￭ Z￭ Ö eleven percent of the votes - however ￭, at the same time ￭, the Social Democrats expressed fear of a repetition of the year 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 9 ￭, when the People ￭'￭ s Party agreed with the populists (￭ F￭ P￭ Ö was still united at that time ￭, it broke away from B￭ Z￭ Ö in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 5 ￭) on a common government ￭, which eventually provoked sanctions from the European Union ￭.
The Green Party also got into the parliament ￭, but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties ￭.
Evi￭ d￭ ently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliament ￭.
While nearly every cell phone can play M￭ P ￭3 files ￭, no M￭ P ￭3 player can make phone calls ￭.
First of all such music products not available on L￭ Ps ￭, but also ￭, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it ￭.
It ￭'￭ s the same with music on tri￭ ps ￭, that is ￭, com￭ pressed music ￭, simply put ￭, M￭ P ￭3 music ￭.
Some top ￭-￭ of ￭-￭ the ￭-￭ line music players can do much more than merely play music ￭, but also what most cell phones can ￭'￭ t even do by chance ￭.
In addition to the primary functions ￭, calling and tex￭ ting ￭, it can play music and video ￭, record both ￭, contains a cam￭ era which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navig￭ ate in some cases ￭.
It ￭'￭ s a small miracle ￭, as there is no ref￭ rig￭ er￭ ator that knows how to gr￭ ill and no television can take pictures ￭.
The more functions you use on your cell phone ￭, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger ￭.
In this way ￭, music players (￭ particularly the simpl￭ est ones ￭) are much more efficient ￭.
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that ￭, to be on the safe side ￭, get another charger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices ￭.
Of course ￭, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card ￭, but very few card read￭ ers can handle the mini￭ ature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adap￭ tor ￭.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the direc￭ tory ￭, similar to W￭ in￭ do￭ ws Ex￭ pl￭ orer and some are able to do both (￭ i￭ river ￭, Sam￭ sun￭ g ￭, S￭ ony ￭, C￭ ow￭ on ￭, smart phones with an operating systems ￭) ￭.
Mu￭ si￭ c players easier to service ￭, cell phones can do more
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while ￭, perhaps in the tra￭ m ￭, any cell phone which plays M￭ P ￭3 is enough ￭.
It one of the most widespread form￭ ats and in addition to it ￭, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in W￭ MA format ￭.
The prices are also not among the lowest ￭.
It is generally assumed ￭, however ￭, that this very manner of music sales (￭ whether using G￭ SM ￭, the Internet or wi￭ reless Internet ￭) will take over the music industry in the future ￭.
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crow￭ ns ￭.
For three or four thousand crow￭ ns ￭, you can get a very decent wal￭ kman ￭.
Anyone can handle the operation of the simpl￭ est - not necessarily the most in￭ expensive (￭ see our selection ￭) - music players ￭.
These devices have separate control but￭ tons for M￭ P ￭3 and the user ￭-￭ friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate M￭ P ￭3 player ￭.
The M￭ P ￭3 players from the br￭ ands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crow￭ ns ￭, but with a greater memory capacity (￭ up to 1￭ 6 GB ￭) and battery en￭ dur￭ ance (￭ normally 1￭ 5 hours ￭, maxim￭ ally up to 3￭ 5 hours ￭) ￭.
In spite of this ￭, there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices ￭.
It is precisely the entr￭ ance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices ￭, to which even the classic operators had to react ￭.
At the same time ￭, even before the entr￭ ance on the market of aggressive competitors such as T￭ esco Mob￭ ile or Virg￭ in Mob￭ ile ￭, voices similar to those here could be heard ￭.
Over the course of merely half a year ￭, this operator was able to gain more than 1￭ 0￭ 0 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator ￭.
In this way ￭, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low ￭-￭ cost - they offer in￭ expensive calling and text messages ￭, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services ￭, though ￭.
That ￭'￭ s how ￭, for example ￭, T￭ esco Mob￭ ile in Great Britain can offer text mess￭ aging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors ￭.
"￭ Real men choose Mob￭ il￭ king - the operator that they like and can trust ￭, ￭" says David S￭ ei￭ bert ￭, the CEO of Mob￭ ile Enter￭ t￭ ainment Company ￭, which runs this virtual operator ￭.
For a longer period of time now ￭, the G￭ TS No￭ vera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator ￭, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competi￭ tor of Tel￭ e￭ fon￭ ica O ￭2 in the area of corporate client￭ e￭ le ￭.
"￭ We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hard￭ wi￭ re telecommun￭ ication services ￭, but also mobile ones ￭.
Com￭ pared to other markets ￭, the Czech market is very specific ￭.
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area ￭, ￭" claimed V￭ las￭ tim￭ il Sr￭ š￭ e￭ ň from the public relations department of Tel￭ e￭ fon￭ ica 0￭ 2 in a statement for Mob￭ il ￭.￭ c￭ z ￭.
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand ￭, the entr￭ ance of another operator would mean increased competition ￭, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits ￭.
Regarding that matter ￭, Mar￭ tina K￭ em￭ ro￭ v￭ á pointed out ￭: "￭ The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently ampli￭ fied by the entr￭ ance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market ￭.
This means not only the attitude of the C￭ TO ￭, which unfortunately in Cz￭ ec￭ hi￭ a - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition ￭.
"￭ The entr￭ ance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the r￭ ental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator ￭.
No such contract has ever been signed ￭, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators ￭, ￭" claimed K￭ ris￭ ti￭ án Ch￭ alu￭ p￭ a from the external relations department of the O￭ PC in his answer to our question ￭.
"￭ The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition ￭, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way ￭.
None of the operators have a dominant position ￭, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market ￭.
Of course ￭, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist ￭, conducted by C￭ TO ￭, according to which telecommunications are ￭, from the perspective of competition ￭, the only market ￭.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator ￭, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator ￭.
But even if we did not consider this argument ￭, for the O￭ PC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a stri￭ k￭ ingly similar manner ￭.
Unfortunately ￭, it was not possible to establish the extension of the C￭ TO ￭'￭ s authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telec￭ ommun￭ ications Act ￭, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation ￭.
The trick lies in the fact that ￭, in relation to the operator ￭, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SI￭ M cards ￭.
As a significant client ￭, it then gets special price offers (￭ and other types of offers ￭) ￭.
"￭ If the cases you are talking about were to occur ￭, this could be a violation of the contract conditions ￭, which we would investigate ￭, and it could culmin￭ ate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company ￭, ￭" Mar￭ tina K￭ em￭ ro￭ v￭ á answered our question on this problem ￭.
On top of that ￭, they must accept that the SI￭ M card in their telephone is not registered under their name ￭, and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can ￭. ￭"
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure ￭, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ￭?
It must be added that the O￭ PC has rather considerable power to un￭ cover such activities ￭, and if it does not wish to ￭, it does not have to be satisfied with operators ￭' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it ￭.
At the same time ￭, classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created ￭.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small ￭, too s￭ atur￭ ated ￭, problems with the quality of services ￭, etc ￭.
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator ￭, it will be difficult for O￭ PC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (￭ discrimination ￭) of further interested parties ￭.

That is ￭, they can buy the coup￭ on over the Internet and it will be added to the Op￭ enc￭ ard at one of the thir￭ teen branches of the City Li￭ br￭ ary ￭.
All you have to do is in￭ sert the Op￭ enc￭ ard chi￭ p card ￭, and the pre ￭-￭ paid card is automatically added to it ￭.
"￭ In trains included in Prague Integr￭ ated Transport ￭, the conduc￭ tors are equipped with card read￭ ers ￭, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the coup￭ ons ￭, ￭" F￭ ili￭ p Dr￭ á￭ pal from the organization R￭ op￭ id ￭, which creates the timetables of the Prague M￭ ass Transport ￭, explained the ticket ￭-￭ checking procedures ￭.
"￭ If the trav￭ eller needs to confirm the validity of the coup￭ ons recorded ￭, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver ￭, ￭" Dr￭ á￭ pal added ￭.

"￭ We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as op￭ press￭ ors and enemies ￭, but rather ￭, as liber￭ ators ￭, ￭" is what is written in the letter ￭, signed "￭ People who are not indifferent to the fate of Š￭ um￭ ava ￭" ￭.

According to Foreign Minister Kare￭ l Sch￭ war￭ z￭ enberg ￭, if it will not be possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists charged in India with the illegal collection of be￭ et￭ les ￭, a certain worsening of Czech ￭-￭ Indian relations could take place ￭.

Law doesn ￭'￭ t know them ￭, wal￭ king in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Stu￭ dent Agency near Pad￭ u￭ a ￭, Italy ￭, the question has arisen as to whether st￭ ew￭ ards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion ￭.
"￭ If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law ￭, the activities of the ste￭ ward are in conflict with the Traff￭ ic Law ￭, ￭" says speaker for the Ministry of Trans￭ port￭ ation Kare￭ l Han￭ z￭ el￭ ka ￭.
The accident ￭, during which a twenty ￭-￭ two ￭-￭ year ￭-￭ old st￭ ew￭ ard￭ ess died last week ￭, was evidently caused by the driver of the truc￭ k that crossed into the path of the bus ￭.
"￭ There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the ste￭ ward - no legal en￭ act￭ ments deal with this role ￭.
The Traff￭ ic Law only knows the term vehicle conduc￭ tor ￭; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person ￭, ￭" speaker Han￭ z￭ el￭ ka added less unambiguously ￭.
B￭ uses are divided into the categories of city bus ￭, where there is standing room and limited maximum speed ￭, inter ￭-￭ city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted ￭, and coach buses ￭, with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat bel￭ ts ￭.
J￭ aro￭ slav Ho￭ ř￭ ín ￭, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traff￭ ic Safety (￭ B￭ ES￭ IP ￭) ￭, does not see any essential problem in the movement of st￭ ew￭ ards on the buses ￭.
The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl ￭'￭ s family ￭, but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party ￭.
They are not dealing with buses much ￭, it is more the point system ￭, the maximum speed on the high￭ way and the use of cell phones while driving ￭, ￭" says expert Ho￭ ř￭ ín ￭.
"￭ The Ministry of Trans￭ port￭ ation does not consider the activity of the st￭ ew￭ ards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way ￭, ￭" concludes speaker Han￭ z￭ el￭ ka ￭, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office ￭.
That is ￭, according to a UN agreement they are utili￭ zing the rights on which they agreed in 1￭ 9￭ 8￭ 2 in Mon￭ te￭ go Bay ￭, Jam￭ ai￭ ca ￭.
"￭ One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and speci￭ alized technical assistance ￭.
But the administrative board of De￭ ka ￭, which is owned in equal parts by the L￭ and￭ es￭ ban￭ ken and the savings banks associations ￭, has asked the board of directors to commence talks with West￭ L￭ B on joint business v￭ entures ￭.

This aside ￭, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative ￭.
Should the pressure for more mergers increase ￭, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners ￭.
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions ￭' different business models are compatible with another ￭.
Ultimately ￭, West￭ L￭ B might also be split up ￭, although ￭, of course ￭, that ￭'￭ s not a solution fav￭ ored at West￭ L￭ B ￭.

They have been making tri￭ ps to the O￭ k￭ tob￭ er￭ f￭ est for five years now ￭, three of them this year alone ￭.
St￭ aying over night would only generate unnecessary costs ￭, Marco says ￭.
The trip is 7￭ 5 Euro￭ s ￭, including a welcoming round of K￭ ais￭ er be￭ er ￭, bre￭ w￭ ed according to the Bav￭ arian P￭ urity Law ￭, health insurance ￭, as well as a German ￭-￭ language guide - Marco en￭ rol￭ led in a language course in Frankfurt ￭.

Munich ￭'￭ s police are reinforced by seven polic￭ emen from South Ty￭ rol ￭, and Italian volunteers are lending support to the Bav￭ arian Red Cross ￭, according to whose statistics on nationals the Italians are leading the medical ￭-￭ attention field with about 2￭ 0￭ 0 cases ￭, with Austri￭ ans (￭ about 8￭ 0 cases ￭) and Brit￭ ons (￭ about 6￭ 0 cases ￭) coming in second and third ￭.
As recently as last week ￭, German Finance Minister Pe￭ er Ste￭ in￭ bru￭ eck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable ￭.
The real ￭-￭ estate bank H￭ yp￭ o Real E￭ state (￭ H￭ RE ￭) from Munich ￭, which is listed in the D￭ A￭ X stock index ￭, is receiving credits in the billions from a consorti￭ um of German banks in order to be shi￭ el￭ ded against the market turbulences ￭.
According to a news report ￭, the government ￭-￭ funding bank had re￭ financed long ￭-￭ term projects it was financing on very short notice - which ￭, due to the mistrust at the markets ￭, is no longer a possibility ￭.
In the first half ￭-￭ year of 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 ￭, the bank ￭'￭ s cash reserve had sh￭ run￭ k by 9￭ 5 percent to 2 ￭.￭ 3￭ 7 Euro￭ s ￭, with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1 ￭.￭ 6 to 1 ￭.￭ 4￭ 5 percent ￭.
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to ni￭ l compared to the same period in the previous year ￭, while earnings from write ￭-￭ ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of acc￭ ru￭ als from credit transactions had sh￭ run￭ k by more than 7￭ 0 percent to 5 million Euro￭ s ￭.
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 1￭ 6 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from down￭ stream accounting costs from restructuring the former D￭ ep￭ f￭ a Group ￭, as well as from refunds of interest according to the Fis￭ cal Code and from agency for group companies ￭.
Because earnings in classical government ￭-￭ funding were sli￭ m ￭, D￭ ep￭ f￭ a had diversified internationally ￭, increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint v￭ entures between private investors and the government (￭ Public ￭-￭ Private Partnership ￭, P￭ PP ￭) ￭.
Now H￭ yp￭ o Real E￭ state has to induce write ￭-￭ offs according to the subsidiary ￭'￭ s worth that will have a `￭ significant ￭, material effect ￭' on the group ￭'￭ s profit ￭-￭ and ￭-￭ loss statement ￭, it said rather vagu￭ ely ￭.
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Lehman Brothers ￭, the extension of loans among banks has largely dri￭ ed up again ￭, because banks are ho￭ ar￭ ding their assets ￭.
It ￭'￭ s not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed ￭.
Whereas senior debts are hardly moving ￭, ju￭ ni￭ or bonds are drop￭ ping more significantly ￭.
To date ￭, H￭ yp￭ o Real E￭ state bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment ￭. After the financial crisis ￭, as well as the bank ￭'￭ s own hom￭ em￭ ade crisis caused by the acquisition of D￭ ep￭ f￭ a ￭, however ￭, their reco￭ ver￭ ability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system ￭.
As long as central banks ￭, governments and less stric￭ ken corporate banks are still willing to support the system ￭, bond settlement deadlines can be met ￭.
But considering that one report of partial nation￭ alization is ch￭ asing the next ￭, a probability bordering on certainty has now sh￭ run￭ k to a valid hope ￭.
More and more details are sur￭ facing on the circumstances surrounding the liberation of the eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt ￭.
According to the German Federal Minis￭ tries of Defense and of the Interior ￭, German special forces indirectly took part in the rescue mission ￭.
Speci￭ alists of the Federal Ar￭ med Forces (￭ Bundes￭ we￭ h￭ r ￭) and members of the German Federal Police (￭ B￭ pol ￭) and its G￭ S￭ G 9 and Air Gu￭ ard special units were present at the rescue ￭, spokes￭ men of the ministries said Monday night ￭, as well as members of the Federal Criminal Police Office (￭ B￭ K￭ A ￭) and logistics experts of the Agency of Technical Reli￭ ef (￭ T￭ H￭ W ￭) ￭.
The German forces were not required ￭, however ￭, they said ￭, because the cap￭ tors abandoned their hostages and fled when they became aware that the hostages were about to be freed by force ￭.
After their abduction in a desert region in the south of Egypt ￭, the hostages had been carried back and forth in the border region between Egypt ￭, Libya ￭, Sudan and Chad ￭.
According to German newspaper `￭ Bil￭ d ￭, ￭' the five tourists and the special forces are to board an Airbus of the German Air Force ￭, which is said to arrive in Germany on Tuesday ￭.
When Sy￭ lv￭ ana H￭ il￭ trop ￭, 1￭ 6 years old ￭, is asked to introduce herself on her first day at T￭ achi￭ ban￭ a High School ￭, the girls begin to gi￭ ggle ￭: The German girl is totally `￭ k￭ aw￭ ai￭ i ￭' ￭!
Stu￭ dents begin tric￭ k￭ ling in at eight o ￭'￭ clock ￭, until a brief conference with the teacher ￭, the `￭ home room ￭, ￭' starts at 8 ￭:￭ 4￭ 0 ￭.
The girl be￭ side me was s￭ mil￭ ing rather bri￭ ghtly ￭. She thought it was an hon￭ or that the exchange student should be seated next to her ￭.
The stuff looks we￭ ir￭ d and has a completely novel taste ￭.
And in order to have a better understanding of the com￭ ics and the culture in them ￭, I eventually started to learn a little Japanese ￭, as well ￭.
On the one hand ￭, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends ￭, but on the other hand it is strict ￭, discipl￭ ined and traditional ￭.
But if they act the same way we do ￭, how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings ￭?
In a series ￭, SP￭ I￭ E￭ GE￭ L ON￭ L￭ IN￭ E presents a selection of responses to the question ￭, `￭ What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it ￭? ￭'
I believe that animals have feelings ￭, as well as other modes of awareness ￭, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date ￭. For that matter ￭, we haven ￭'￭ t even been able to prove that other people possess awareness ￭.
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other prim￭ ates ￭, and it seems to be entirely missing in other cre￭ atures ￭.
But even if awareness was not dependent on language ￭, it would certainly be affected by it ￭, meaning that animal awareness ￭, however it may be defined ￭, would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness ￭.
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness ￭, but aside from that ￭, there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically ￭.
In theory ￭, I can ￭'￭ t disagree with that ￭, but I consider it impro￭ v￭ able ￭.
Pan￭ k￭ se￭ ep argues that what seemed to be fear with r￭ ats and humans probably felt like it ￭, as well ￭, in both cases ￭. But how can we determine whether r￭ ats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways ￭?
The neu￭ ral comparison is helpful ￭, granted ￭: R￭ ats and humans have similar br￭ ain￭ stems ￭, whereas ro￭ aches do not even have br￭ ains ￭.
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for r￭ ats ￭?
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (￭ since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language ￭) ￭, I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sens￭ ations of r￭ ats ￭.
Just like I don ￭'￭ t study language and awareness in r￭ ats ￭, neither do I study their emotions ￭, given that I don ￭'￭ t even know if they exist ￭.

And yet in many ways ￭, the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Flori￭ da travel guide produced by the Depression ￭-￭ era Federal W￭ rit￭ ers ￭' Project - remains a place apart ￭.
It is as independent ￭, dignified and private as it was in the 1￭ 9￭ 3￭ 0￭ s ￭, when H￭ ur￭ ston wrote that rural bl￭ acks in Flori￭ da often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man ￭, who "￭ knowing so little about us ￭, he doesn ￭'￭ t know what he is missing ￭. ￭"

A Court Service spokesman said ￭: ￭"￭ On Thursday September 2￭ 5 at Ash￭ ford Mag￭ istr￭ ates ￭' Court ￭, K￭ ent Police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to France and Spain until March 2￭ 5 by Mr Paul G￭ add ￭.
A K￭ ent Police spokes￭ woman said ￭: "￭ K￭ ent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country ￭, or abroad ￭.
"￭ From our point of view ￭, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risks more effectively ￭.
"￭ Protec￭ ting the residents of K￭ ent is the paramount concern of K￭ ent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the coun￭ ty to minimise any risk to the public that may exist ￭. ￭"
G￭ lit￭ ter returned to the UK last month after spending 2￭ 7 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls ￭, aged 1￭ 0 and 1￭ 1 ￭.
A Home Office source said that Jac￭ qui Smith ￭, the Home Secretary was reassured and glad that G￭ lit￭ ter has been stopped from travelling to France and Spain ￭.
"￭ I photo￭ graph the master away from the scene to extract his character ￭" Gün￭ ther Bauer ￭, photo￭ grap￭ her
The two sides are in￭ separ￭ able ￭, except in private life ￭. In those moments ￭, away from the public ￭, the privacy of a gesture ￭, the depth of a stolen glance or the expres￭ siveness of the hands ￭, are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage ￭.
The exhi￭ bition ￭, included in the Mon￭ th of F￭ lam￭ enc￭ o P￭ ho￭ to￭ graphy ￭'￭ s program ￭, reflects the importance of international flam￭ enc￭ o ￭, which increases day by day ￭" the arti￭ st explains ￭. He also clarifies that in "￭ F￭ lam￭ enc￭ o ￭-￭ People ￭" even it should be ordinary people ￭, going through the pictures ￭, the observers get these are not the classic images of artists ￭, interpreters or perform￭ ers on stage ￭.
The application of different st￭ y￭ lis￭ tic techniques breaks with the i￭ con￭ o￭ graphic traditional principles ￭, giving the photos modern￭ ity ￭, as Bauer considers flam￭ enc￭ o ￭: "￭ A music with very traditional roots which evol￭ ves and still surprises every day more ￭. ￭"
It is not the d￭ ancing ￭, the s￭ inging or the playing itself ￭, but the arti￭ st ￭'￭ s personality ￭, his character ￭, able to con￭ quer the audience through his art ￭.
Fam￭ ous flam￭ enc￭ o artists such as Di￭ e￭ go El C￭ ig￭ ala ￭, Ch￭ an L￭ ob￭ ato ￭, Cris￭ tina H￭ oy￭ os ￭, En￭ rique Mor￭ ente ￭, El Le￭ bri￭ ja ￭, Antonio Can￭ ales and Vic￭ ente A￭ mi￭ go among others ￭, are included in this selection of around sev￭ enty portr￭ ayed artists ￭.
The passion for the por￭ trait led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "￭ Por￭ traits of v￭ eter￭ an ath￭ let￭ es ￭" ￭( ￭"￭ S￭ port￭ AR￭ T￭ project ￭" ￭) ￭.
You meet or face people and char￭ act￭ ers sometimes you even know or persons who bes￭ to￭ w you only a few minutes to take the picture ￭.
The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject ￭. Despite this ￭, Mario V￭ arg￭ as L￭ lo￭ sa is struggling with the new project he is working at ￭, a novel whose protagon￭ ist ￭, Ro￭ ger Cas￭ em￭ ant ￭, is an Irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and crossed Amazon ￭.
In￭ tro￭ duc￭ ed by F￭ éli￭ x R￭ ome￭ o ￭, the writer faced a public whose time fle￭ w away when the Per￭ u￭ vian author ￭, started to recall with a prodi￭ gious memory and with large doses of humour ￭, the way he discovered his liter￭ ary vocation ￭, derived from the "￭ extraordinary adv￭ enture and the pleasure of reading ￭. ￭" This is "￭ living beyond life ￭" ￭, as he put it in ￭. He explained why orderly basis in writing permits "￭ to remove the lack of inspiration ￭, ￭" through an intense work of documentation ￭, edi￭ ting and revising ￭. He underlined how F￭ aul￭ k￭ ner ￭, Vic￭ tor Hugo and Alex￭ andre D￭ um￭ as affected his vocation and said that the "￭ images of memory ￭" are the foundation from which his stories spring up ￭.
The His￭ panic ￭-￭ American nov￭ el￭ ist ￭, acknowledged that "￭ there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people ￭'￭ s lives ￭. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and eph￭ emer￭ al entert￭ ainment experience ￭, ￭" said V￭ arg￭ as L￭ lo￭ sa who ￭, also supported that "￭ the literature has a strong impact and pus￭ hes people to be non￭ conform￭ ist ￭. ￭" So he suggested the writ￭ ers "￭ not to give into fri￭ vol￭ ity ￭" and to "￭ take the responsibility ￭" of their own vocation ￭.
The officers ch￭ ase after them ￭, are succeed in ar￭ resting one over two occup￭ ants ￭. The man ￭, 2￭ 8 years old ￭, is identified as A ￭. A ￭. J ￭. ￭, as reported in a press release by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government ￭.
According to a spokesman for the police ￭, the act￭ ress has proven collabor￭ ative and the hypo￭ thesis of excessive alcohol was dis￭ car￭ ded since the very first moment ￭, even if "￭ as the officers observed at first sight ￭, we believe Ms ￭. Loc￭ k￭ le￭ ar was under the effect of any drug ￭. ￭"
"￭ I ￭'￭ m very federalist when considering this kind of issues ￭, and the And￭ alu￭ sian organization needs to assume its responsibilities ￭, ￭" said L￭ lam￭ az￭ ares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an al￭ der￭ man in Si￭ vig￭ li￭ an board until now ￭.
Moreover ￭, the leader stressed the need for "￭ transparency ￭" in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregul￭ arity Silva had committed ￭, "￭ The U￭ I always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency ￭. ￭"
With this film ￭, the director has tried to "￭ explain the tor￭ rent of char￭ act￭ ers and at the same time the social analysis ￭" that he always admi￭ red in the work of the famous nov￭ el￭ ist ￭, he said today ￭, during the film ￭'￭ s presentation ￭, with Qu￭ im Guti￭ er￭ rez and P￭ au￭ la E￭ chev￭ arr￭ ía heading a larger cast of interpreters ￭.
S￭ ang￭ re de may￭ o ￭, a film longer than 2 ￭.￭ 3￭ 0 hours ￭, de￭ buts this Friday at the cin￭ em￭ as ￭, to become a four hours TV minis￭ eries on Tel￭ e￭ Madrid in next future ￭.
Great fan of Gal￭ d￭ ó￭ s ￭' literature ￭, J￭ ose Lu￭ is Gar￭ ci claims this shooting realized "￭ a dream of his childhood ￭" ￭. He likes to thank Es￭ per￭ an￭ za A￭ gu￭ ir￭ re ￭, who ￭, three years earlier ￭, had commissioned him to sho￭ ot a film to commemor￭ ate the second cent￭ en￭ ary of the Madrid 2￭ nd of May ￭. This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid ￭. The director agreed on condition that the story gr￭ ounded on the novel E￭ p￭ is￭ odi￭ os N￭ aci￭ onales ￭.
The 1￭ 5 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Gar￭ ci a "￭ unique opportunity ￭" to recre￭ ate the appropriate sets and co￭ stu￭ mes to portr￭ ay a "￭ stun￭ ned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the reign of Fer￭ din￭ and VII ￭" said Gar￭ ci ￭.
However ￭, the director regrets not having received equal funds of A￭ la￭ triste or L￭ os fant￭ asm￭ as de G￭ oya - more than twice compared to S￭ ang￭ re de may￭ o ￭. So far ￭, it was not possible to sho￭ ot some scenes included in the plan ￭, he himself had signed together with Hor￭ acio Val￭ car￭ c￭ el ￭, his career ￭-￭ long collabor￭ ator ￭.
The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Vol￭ ver a em￭ pe￭ z￭ ar ￭: for example ￭, the st￭ aging with the actors ￭, with whom he often uses to re￭ hear￭ se before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast ￭, considering this "￭ humiliating ￭" and thinking that "￭ the work of the director lies in going to the thea￭ tre and to the cin￭ ema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on ￭. ￭"
"￭ At first you think of working for po￭ sterity ￭, then you realize you only work for the prosperity ￭, and at certain point you just sho￭ ot a film more ￭, ￭" says Gar￭ cia after more 3￭ 0 years of career ￭.
A si￭ vig￭ li￭ an d￭ ancer pays tribute to another si￭ vig￭ li￭ an d￭ ancer ￭.

Thus ￭, "￭ la dan￭ za de la Mari￭ pos￭ a ￭" suggested me a gu￭ aj￭ ira ￭, or the "￭ dan￭ za de la ser￭ pi￭ ente ￭" some t￭ ang￭ os ￭.

The photos drew my attention because of their simpli￭ city and power which trans￭ mit ￭, always treating the subjects with particular attention ￭.
The publication "￭ Di￭ ario de un po￭ eta re￭ ci￭ é￭ n cas￭ ado ￭" clo￭ ses the 3 Y￭ ears An￭ nivers￭ ary ￭'￭ s celebration
The presentation of the first illustrated edi￭ tion of "￭ Di￭ ario de un Po￭ eta Rec￭ i￭ enc￭ as￭ ado ￭" at Saint Stephen ￭'￭ s Church ￭(￭ New York ￭) ￭, the place where Ju￭ an Ram￭ ón Jim￭ é￭ nez married Z￭ en￭ ob￭ ia in March 1￭ 9￭ 1￭ 6 ￭, falls within the plan made by the Department of Culture of the Committee of And￭ alu￭ sia to celebrate the "￭ 3 Y￭ ears An￭ nivers￭ ary of Z￭ en￭ ob￭ ia and Ju￭ an Ram￭ on ￭" (￭ 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 6 ￭-￭ 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 ￭) ￭, organized to commemor￭ ate the fif￭ ti￭ eth anniversary of the allocation of the Nobel Prize in L￭ iter￭ ature and the death of both ￭.
So far ￭, the "￭ 3 Y￭ ears An￭ nivers￭ ary of Z￭ en￭ ob￭ ia and Ju￭ an Ram￭ on ￭" ends with the second edi￭ tion of this work ￭, with the International Congress held in New York ￭, the restoration of the house ￭-￭ mus￭ eum of the Nobel pri￭ zed and the travelling exhi￭ bition "￭ Ju￭ an Ram￭ ón Jim￭ é￭ nez ￭: A￭ quel cho￭ p de lu￭ z ￭" ￭, which was inaug￭ ur￭ ated last May and ￭, after having touched the various provinces of And￭ alu￭ sia ￭, is expected to be brought to New York in conjunction with the International Congress ￭.
For all people he embodied the Plat￭ onic ideal of beauty and truth ￭.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and a supporter of lost and won causes ￭, starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the fir￭ st￭ born who died of over￭ doses until the promotion of a new brand for home ￭-￭ made and organic food ￭.
The bad boy arrived from Australia ￭, Rus￭ sell Cro￭ we ￭, arrived to define Paul New￭ man as his biggest inspiration ￭.
"￭ Why am I going out to have my h￭ amb￭ urg￭ ers ￭, when I can have a good ste￭ ak at home ￭? ￭" used to joke himself ￭.
We went there just to collect the back number (￭ first nonsense ￭, just go for this only reason ￭) and (￭ after the qu￭ eue ￭) ￭, surprise ￭! they only had "￭ S ￭" size T ￭-￭ shir￭ ts (￭ second nonsense ￭, because I need an X￭ L ￭) ￭.
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T ￭-￭ shir￭ ts ￭, made with smaller tissu￭ e and therefore less expensive ￭?
We had to go very early to collect the chi￭ p but the qu￭ eue was 1￭ 5 minutes long and ￭, furthermore ￭, you had to deposit your back￭ p￭ ack ￭.
The wait lasted more than 3￭ 5 minutes ￭, something incomprehensible for a race where you expect more than 1￭ 1 ￭,￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 people ￭.
In addition ￭, the rain threatened the waiting longer than 4￭ 0 minutes ￭, which went along with a kind of popular re￭ bellion and an attempted assault to stand ￭.
I believe we will be around 5￭ 0￭ 0 people surely with pneu￭ mon￭ ia tomorrow ￭, and some ￭, like me ￭, not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chi￭ p ￭, which ￭, I suppose ￭, did not record the arrival time properly ￭.
During the conference on E￭ merging Technolo￭ gies at the MIT ￭, Microsoft presented a pre￭ view of the new recognition and human interaction system ￭, a kind of artificial intelligence ￭, but without that much intelligence ￭, able to perform some basic tasks ￭, such as call a taxi (￭ or ￭, in the scenario described by Microsoft ￭, a shut￭ tle service to move within the company ￭'￭ s camp￭ us ￭) "￭ understanding ￭" what happens in a standard conversation ￭.
Thanks to a cam￭ era and a forms and faces ￭' recognition system ￭, this "￭ rec￭ ep￭ tion￭ ist ￭" may know how many people are there in a specific room ￭, who are they – including remember what ￭'￭ s their position - and listen and understand the key￭ words in a conversation with them ￭.
The dem￭ o showed that the rec￭ ep￭ tion￭ ist notes a third person ￭, understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company ￭'￭ s employee ￭.
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues ￭, such as the next W￭ in￭ do￭ ws operating system ￭'￭ s release ￭.
St￭ eve B￭ all￭ mer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rub￭ b￭ ish ￭, these should be five times faster - he￭ y ￭! St￭ eve ￭, will be for less ￭.
A real discovery ￭, if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft ￭, version after version has only added features and "￭ extr￭ as ￭" to W￭ in￭ do￭ ws ￭.
Microsoft is right ￭: the operating system will be increasingly losing importance ￭, and the software with it ￭.
When Google launched Ch￭ ro￭ me ￭, I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with W￭ in￭ do￭ ws ￭.
It won ￭'￭ t ever disappear ￭, perhaps you just need to think about the "￭ death ￭" of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one ￭.
People give less attention to the operating system ￭, and increasingly focus on the bro￭ w￭ ser ￭.
And W￭ in￭ do￭ ws 7 should be less ￭, much less than V￭ ist￭ a ￭.
L￭ ess heavy ￭, less loaded ￭, less complex ￭.
A sign ￭, hanging on the soft drinks ￭' machine suggested them to use the company ￭'￭ s search engine - "￭ Your search ￭. Our Future ￭" ￭.
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch ￭, W￭ in￭ do￭ ws 7 and W￭ in￭ do￭ ws Mob￭ ile 7 together ￭.
Our phones ￭, at the very end ￭, is increasingly becoming a computer ￭.
First of all ￭, this is due to its gran￭ di￭ ose name - even if it is commonly known just as "￭ Mar￭ c￭ el ￭" - name that has something to do with the sport because it der￭ ives ￭, according to the leg￭ end ￭, from the bo￭ x￭ er Mar￭ c￭ el Cer￭ dan ￭, who loved the sing￭ er Ed￭ ith Pi￭ af ￭.
The "￭ Mar￭ c￭ el ￭" exc￭ els - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton ￭, for its un￭ is￭ ex cutting ￭, for his distinctive little shield and the small Belgian flag (￭ barely recogni￭ z￭ able ￭) ￭, which the most emb￭ lem￭ atic models keep as a detail on the nec￭ k ￭.
Among others ￭, it is worth pointing out its innovative design ￭, new platform ￭, bigger size and pretty new mechan￭ ics ￭.
Any￭ way ￭, before moving on to analy￭ ze the new model ￭, may be useful to point out that this new J￭ az￭ z comes only six years after the entry of the first generation ￭.
Regarding the Spanish market ￭, H￭ ond￭ a has sold a total of 8 ￭,￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 units of J￭ az￭ z since 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 2 ￭, corresponding to 6 ￭.￭ 7 ￭% of total sales for the company in Spain ￭.
In fact ￭, the persons in charge for the brand expect to get to the end of the year with a total of 2￭ 2 ￭,￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 units sold ￭, that is 4 ￭.￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 units less than in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 7 ￭, with a decrease of 1￭ 6 ￭% ￭.
Despite the increase in sales ￭, H￭ ond￭ a has also incre￭ ment￭ ed its market share in Spain ￭, reaching the 1 ￭.￭ 8 ￭% ￭, compared to the last year 1 ￭.￭ 6 ￭% ￭.
According to the markets and Japanese manufacturers ￭' estimates ￭, the 5￭ 0 ￭% of In￭ sight ￭'￭ s sale will come from the United States ￭, while the remaining 5￭ 0 ￭% will be from both the O￭ ld Contin￭ ent and Japan ￭.
It reaches now 3 ￭,￭ 9￭ 0 met￭ ers length (￭ five centi￭ metres more ￭) ￭, 1 ￭,￭ 6￭ 9 met￭ ers wid￭ th (￭ two centi￭ metres more ￭) and its inter￭ ax￭ le 2 ￭,￭ 5￭ 0 met￭ ers ￭, with an incre￭ ment of five centi￭ metres ￭.
This advantage stems ￭, first of all from the new platform ￭, and second from the introduction of the fuel t￭ ank in a central location ￭, a solution already adopted in the previous J￭ az￭ z ￭.
Moreover ￭, the tr￭ un￭ k ￭'￭ s capacity - a double bottom volume - rises to 3￭ 9￭ 9 litres ￭, a 1￭ 9 litres bigger capacity respect to the first generation ￭.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements ￭, such as the re￭ ar led or the possibility to mount the pan￭ or￭ am￭ ic glass - concern the improved access to back seats ￭.
Do￭ ors which allow access to back seats ￭, open now with an angle of 8￭ 0 degrees ￭, compared to 6￭ 7 degrees in the first model ￭.
Both mechan￭ ical systems will include the i ￭-￭ V￭ T￭ EC technology which permits a lower fuel consumption ￭, produces less carbon dioxide emissions ￭, opti￭ mi￭ zes the mechan￭ ical refin￭ ements and ￭, at the same time ￭, maintains high tor￭ que engine in all its phases ￭.
The 1 ￭.￭ 2 litre version reaches a power of 9￭ 0 h￭ p at 6￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 r￭ p￭ m with a maximum tor￭ que of 1￭ 1￭ 4 N￭ m ￭. at 4￭ 9￭ 0￭ 0 r￭ p￭ m ￭.
According to Mon￭ ica ￭, it is much more than beautiful girls and cele￭ bri￭ ties who lend their names ￭.
She went to Paris for the campaign M￭ ang￭ o is hanging on to promote the new branch ￭, and the presentation of the most important pri￭ zes for fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house ￭.
I came here to present the new collection my s￭ ister Pen￭ elop￭ e and I have designed for the new M￭ ang￭ o autumn ￭-￭ winter season ￭, to join the second edi￭ tion of '￭ M￭ ang￭ o F￭ as￭ hi￭ on A￭ wards ￭' and the O￭ pera din￭ ner in honour of Val￭ en￭ tin￭ o ￭.
Let ￭'￭ s say ￭, a very intense day but a very exciting one ￭, at the same time ￭.
Then ￭, I like to get lost in the city and look at how women d￭ ress ￭, at the way they combine and mix their clo￭ thes ￭. I do it quite frequently ￭.
I think so ￭, although at the very end ￭, all merg￭ ed and many elements remain cross ￭-￭ field ideas ￭.
I liked clo￭ thes since I was a child ￭. I loved to visit my grand￭ mother to rum￭ m￭ age in my aun￭ t ￭'￭ s cup￭ boards and discover her clo￭ thes ￭.
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors ￭.
Since I was a child ￭, I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness ￭.
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause ￭, but if I had asked to play a pine ￭, I would do it anyway ￭.
The engineers of the Ad￭ v￭ anced Technical Centre of N￭ iss￭ an Mot￭ or C￭ o ￭. have developed this little robo￭ t in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technology of the presti￭ gious University of Tokyo in Japan ￭.
To recre￭ ate these visu￭ al features ￭, engineers developed what they defined a las￭ er loc￭ ator (￭ Las￭ er R￭ ange Fin￭ der ￭) ￭.
"￭ When detec￭ ts an obstacle ￭, the little robo￭ t im￭ it￭ ates the bee ￭'￭ s movements and change direction immediately by turning the whe￭ els at a right or wider angle to avoid the collision ￭.
Unlike a bee ￭, the robo￭ t can not devi￭ ate up￭ wards or down￭ wards ￭, or even di￭ ag￭ onally ￭. It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction its whe￭ els can turn to ￭. Obviously ￭, it cannot run infin￭ ite directions and ways like bees do ￭.
For this reason ￭, N￭ iss￭ an has used a rotation function in addition to the acceleration and dec￭ el￭ eration functions ￭, to permit the little robo￭ t can avoid coll￭ isions ￭.
The robo￭ t uses li￭ thi￭ um ￭-￭ poly￭ mer batteries ￭, which are ligh￭ ter and more durable than the li￭ thi￭ um ￭-￭ ion ty￭ po￭ lo￭ gy ￭.
The initiative is supported by the At￭ tor￭ ney General for Road Safety ￭, together with the General Directorate of Traff￭ ic ￭(￭ D￭ G￭ T ￭) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Security in the Au￭ tom￭ ob￭ ile ￭(￭ F￭ ITS ￭) ￭.
According to statistics ￭, between 3￭ 0 ￭% and 7￭ 5 ￭% of drivers fin￭ ed more than once for dr￭ un￭ k driving ￭, still drive a car ￭.
The '￭ al￭ col￭ oc￭ k ￭' would avoid this ￭, because the device ￭, connected to the vehicle ￭, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it ￭, or in case it detec￭ ts in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law ￭.
And second ￭, to facilitate the implementation of this practice ￭, as the legal reform can be ordin￭ arily made ￭, but ￭, on the contrary ￭, the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law ￭.
The sun￭ set was almost done but the sun ￭'￭ s ra￭ ys still forced you to use your hand as a vis￭ or to see the roy￭ al couple getting off the plane ￭.
Having to face the crisis and to prevent the Americans to be che￭ ated with gar￭ b￭ age loans by banks under doubts of insolvency ￭, created a f￭ un and educational game for Internet users ￭. This is "￭ B￭ ad Credit H￭ ot￭ el ￭" ￭.
The g￭ loom aspect of this hotel and ￭, in particular ￭, of its rec￭ ep￭ tion￭ ist aims to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times before applying for a loan ￭.
Prob￭ ably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award ￭, and probably there is not a living design￭ er as ex￭ qu￭ is￭ ite as Val￭ en￭ tin￭ o ￭.
M￭ ang￭ o has just presented the second edi￭ tion of El Bot￭ ón ￭-￭ M￭ ang￭ o F￭ as￭ hi￭ on A￭ wards ￭, to support the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field ￭.
The proximity of the most ex￭ qu￭ is￭ ite pain￭ tings by Ch￭ ag￭ al made the presidential g￭ ala table prepared by M￭ ang￭ o even more spectacular ￭.
I am not referring to those who wake up very ag￭ itated to tell us something happened to them the day before ￭, but those children who talk while as￭ le￭ ep ￭.
This phenomenon can occur very spor￭ adic￭ ally (￭ just once in life ￭, for example ￭, associated with an episode of high fever ￭) or on a more regular basis (￭ every day ￭, once a week ￭, once in the month . ￭. ￭. ￭) ￭. The day after the child does not remember anything ￭.
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep disorders such as night￭ mar￭ es ￭, night fears ￭, no￭ c￭ tur￭ nal en￭ u￭ re￭ sis (￭ do pe￭ e in bed ￭) ￭, or sle￭ ep￭ wal￭ king ￭, but it is not necessarily the case ￭.
In case the event is particularly intense ￭, the child should be observed and possibly ￭, a specialist should be consulted to check if the ab￭ normal state of anxiety is due to any question ￭, thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings ￭.
We said that this is a ben￭ ign al￭ ter￭ ation ￭, therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders which ￭, instead ￭, can be treated (￭ for example ￭, if coupled with ins￭ om￭ nia or a situation of stress ￭) ￭.
Very nervous children for whom relax￭ ing is a very hard task ￭, need you use relax￭ ation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm ￭.
Rem￭ ember that it is an in￭ offensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it ￭.
If you get what he is saying (￭ which is not the most common situation ￭) does not fall into temptation to make him an interrogation to obtain information ￭.
Do not get anything ￭, because he is sle￭ eping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts ￭.
In addition ￭, you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dre￭ aming about to say that things ￭. Therefore ￭, be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead ￭.
In short ￭, do not worry ￭, it ￭'￭ s nothing serious ￭, just an episode that la￭ sts few minutes ￭.
After a first attempt by the gu￭ est cap￭ tain Kau￭ ff￭ mann who narrow￭ ly missed the goal from a far shot ￭, I￭ ll￭ ha￭ eu￭ ser￭ n went on to take a slight lead and in turn Fon￭ der￭ f￭ lic￭ k from af￭ ar ￭, then with H￭ ir￭ n from high ￭, Rom￭ ain with the tip of his foot or again Di￭ eb￭ old came to tic￭ k￭ le the D￭ ann￭ em￭ ari￭ e defence ￭.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Ri￭ ah￭ i and Tempor￭ ale for D￭ ann￭ em￭ ari￭ e ￭, immediately after the score was opened for I￭ ll￭ ha￭ eu￭ ser￭ ns by Mar￭ ais ￭, well posi￭ tioned to pick up a ball b￭ ounced off an initial attempt by Di￭ eb￭ old (￭ 5￭ 3 ￭' ￭) ￭.
But the I￭ ll￭ ha￭ eu￭ ser￭ n stri￭ ker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the loc￭ ker room a dozen minutes later ￭, leaving his team ￭-￭ m￭ ates num￭ eric￭ ally infer￭ ior ￭.
But D￭ ann￭ em￭ ari￭ e could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the I￭ ll￭ ha￭ eu￭ ser￭ n E￭ lev￭ en who just fell back a little to make its defence more "￭ comp￭ act ￭" ￭, except in the very last few seconds of the game where ￭, after a big mess ￭, the ball went very near the cro￭ s￭ spi￭ ece ￭.
Fac￭ ing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly distur￭ bed the access to several ports in Britt￭ any and Nor￭ man￭ dy ￭, on Tuesday morning at Gu￭ il￭ v￭ ine￭ c port ￭, in Fin￭ ist￭ ère ￭, the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives ￭.
The leisure craft harb￭ our of Qui￭ ber￭ on was also blocked ￭, but the roads to B￭ elle ￭-￭ Is￭ le were not blocked ￭.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel ￭, such as S￭ ables d ￭'￭ Ol￭ onne in Ven￭ dée ￭, where tra￭ w￭ lers remained doc￭ ked at the qu￭ ay￭ side or Le Hav￭ re ￭, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any mer￭ chant ships ￭.
Those at Bou￭ log￭ ne ￭-￭ sur ￭-￭ Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions ￭.
But some Bret￭ on fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries ￭, which did not support their movement ￭.

According to a C￭ BS poll ￭, among the un￭ decided voters ￭, who are those that count ￭, Obama has won 3￭ 9 ￭% of respon￭ dents ￭, while 2￭ 5 ￭% of them give victory to McCain ￭.
The sep￭ tu￭ ag￭ en￭ arian McCain has repeatedly put forward his un￭ questionable experience in foreign policy ￭, while stressing the "￭ nai￭ v￭ ety ￭" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial face ￭-￭ to ￭-￭ face debate ￭.
"￭ McCain has never understood ￭, while Obama ￭, if ￭" ￭, argued this weekend ￭, a Democratic spot critici￭ zing the Republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "￭ American on the streets ￭" ￭.

H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c yesterday celebrated the 1￭ 0￭ th anniversary of its foundation ￭, and its president ￭, Dr ￭. Franc￭ ine D￭ éc￭ ary ￭, had reason to rejoice ￭, because H￭ éma ￭-￭ Que￭ be￭ c has become one of the saf￭ est and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world ￭.
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent ￭, the Government of Canada established in February 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 4 a public inquiry ￭, headed by Justice Hor￭ ace Kre￭ ver ￭, which aimed at sh￭ ed￭ ding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again ￭.
In the wake of the G￭ él￭ in￭ eau and Kre￭ ver reports ￭, two suppliers were created in Canada ￭: H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c to serve Que￭ be￭ c and Canadian Blo￭ od Sup￭ ply for all other provinces and the two territories ￭.
"￭ In 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 8 ￭, when H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c began operations ￭, only 3￭ 8 ￭% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Que￭ be￭ c ￭, re￭ members Dr ￭. D￭ éc￭ ary ￭.
By d￭ int of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed ￭, we have reg￭ ained the confidence of the public ￭" ￭, she says before prou￭ dly affir￭ ming that at the beginning of 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 ￭, nearly 9￭ 4 ￭% of Que￭ be￭ c ￭'￭ s population now had confidence in H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c ￭.
At that time ￭, there were in Europe with the outbreak of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease ￭, a new vari￭ ant of the Creu￭ tz￭ fel￭ dt ￭-￭ Jak￭ ob disease ￭, said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 8 ￭.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Kre￭ ver and G￭ él￭ in￭ eau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result ￭, in this case Creu￭ tz￭ fel￭ dt ￭-￭ Jak￭ ob disease which is characterized by a de￭ generation of the brain leading inevitably to death ￭, one establishes an excluding action ￭.
In 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 9 ￭, on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing ￭: the nu￭ cle￭ ic aci￭ d testing (￭ NA￭ T ￭) allowed to detect directly in don￭ ated blood the virus itself rather than anti￭ bodies against the virus ￭, which is what previous tests were based on ￭.
Since H￭ éma ￭-￭ Que￭ be￭ c each year distribu￭ tes between 4￭ 0￭ 0 0￭ 0￭ 0 and 5￭ 0￭ 0 0￭ 0￭ 0 blood products ￭, it will take more than 2￭ 4 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs ￭.
As recently as last year ￭, there appeared on the island of Reu￭ nion the Chi￭ k￭ ung￭ un￭ ya virus which ￭, like the West N￭ ile virus ￭, is transmitted by an insec￭ t in the blood ￭.
We must be constantly vigilant ￭, "￭ continues Dr ￭. D￭ éc￭ ary before emphasi￭ zing that in addition to a secure supply ￭, H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c must also provide them in sufficient quantities ￭.
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 ￭% of Que￭ bec￭ ers eligible to don￭ ate blood ￭. ￭"
Any healthy person ￭, aged 1￭ 8 and over fits the su￭ itability criteria to give blood every 5￭ 6 days ￭, six times a year ￭.
On average ￭, 1￭ 4 ￭% of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria ￭, for example ￭, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is ri￭ fe ￭, they would be excluded for a period of one year ￭.
Life today runs so fast ￭, there is rarely time to find an hour to don￭ ate one ￭'￭ s blood ￭" ￭, says Franc￭ ine D￭ éc￭ ary mis￭ er￭ ably ￭.
These tissu￭ es are analy￭ zed ￭, processed and frozen before being stored at H￭ éma ￭-￭ Qu￭ é￭ be￭ c ￭, which manages also the only bank of plac￭ ental blood in Que￭ be￭ c ￭.

"￭ P￭ us￭ hing the limits of our last great northern frontier ￭" ￭: this is the long ￭-￭ term ambition that Jean Ch￭ arest presented with visu￭ al strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Que￭ be￭ c ￭, in Lev￭ is yesterday ￭.
The "￭ North Plan ￭" is the fourth part of a "￭ vision ￭" that the prime minister claims to have for Que￭ be￭ c ￭, that of a "￭ new economic space ￭" ￭, which includes an agreement on labour with France ￭, an agreement between Canada and Europe ￭, and agreements with On￭ tari￭ o ￭.
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was "￭ a j￭ ew￭ el with an immense potential ￭" ￭, but never given its due chance ￭, investment money ￭, or specific priority in future projects ￭.
Not only is it with us ￭, but it ￭'￭ s also us ￭" ￭, he insisted ￭, to better show this he soli￭ cited a national founding myth ￭.
The North ￭, 7￭ 0 ￭% of Que￭ be￭ c ￭, includes a portion of Lab￭ rad￭ or that Que￭ be￭ c has always claimed ￭" ￭, said the Prime Minister at the press brief￭ ing ￭.
Moreover ￭, "￭ with the climate changes ￭, we must rethink our vision of the North ￭" ￭, he declared ￭, referring to the Nor￭ th￭ west Pass￭ age ￭, to be held open throughout the year due to mel￭ ting ice ￭.
Two former ministers from two different parties ￭, Pierre Cor￭ be￭ il and Michel L￭ ét￭ our￭ neau (￭ former member Un￭ g￭ ava P￭ Q ￭) ￭, have already started consultations with thirty communities ￭.
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting ￭, "￭ not necessarily a summit ￭, ￭" but a time when "￭ we give ourselves a common vision ￭. ￭"
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development ￭.
Indeed ￭, the Prime Minister ￭, who said in April that there would be no election in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 and probably not even in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 9 ￭, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall ￭, it is what the law permits him ￭.
It also wants Que￭ be￭ c to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telec￭ ommun￭ ications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Que￭ be￭ c ￭.
Had it done so ￭, "￭ it would be more advanced today ￭, ￭" commented Ms ￭. Maro￭ is alongside her candidate in Jean ￭-￭ Tal￭ on (￭ ballot which takes place today ￭) ￭, Franç￭ o￭ ise Mer￭ cure ￭.
If B￭ arr￭ ick G￭ old really wanted a public debate ￭, it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts ￭.
Perhaps Mr Gar￭ ver could explain how he can both call for a "￭ public ￭" debate while at the same time dis￭ regarding the views of that very same audience ￭?
What B￭ arr￭ ick G￭ old does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writ￭ ers and publis￭ h￭ ers of Black Canada ￭, does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods ￭.
The public is ready to hear B￭ arr￭ ick and judge ￭, but on the basis of a civili￭ zed exchange of arguments ￭, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution ￭-￭ ga￭ g (￭ continuing the "￭ public debate ￭" ￭, B￭ arr￭ ick G￭ old has just moreover fil￭ ed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term . ￭. ￭. ￭) ￭.
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress ￭, both the Republicans and the Democrats ￭, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 3￭ 0￭ s ￭.
In particular ￭, it fores￭ ees ￭: a better control by elected officials of its implementation ￭, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed ￭, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non ￭-￭ payment ￭, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescu￭ ed ￭.
U ￭.￭ S ￭. Treasury Secretary ￭, Henry Paul￭ son ￭, the chairman of the House of Representatives ￭, N￭ ancy P￭ elo￭ si ￭, and Republican representative to the negotiating table ￭, Senator Jud￭ d G￭ reg￭ g ￭, announced the good news a few minutes after mid￭ night yesterday ￭, following a mar￭ ath￭ on two ￭-￭ day negotiations ￭.
It comes after a 1￭ 4 month crisis triggered by the bur￭ sting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (￭ sub￭ prime ￭) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit tit￭ les (￭ P￭ CA￭ A ￭) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stam￭ pe￭ de of banks and financial institutions ￭.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 2￭ 5￭ 0 billion to which could be added another 1￭ 0￭ 0 billion if the President de￭ ems necessary ￭.
The other payment of 3￭ 5￭ 0 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress ￭.
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the sei￭ z￭ ure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and sever￭ ance packages paid to executives of companies affected ￭.
After an emergency meeting ￭, the three Ben￭ el￭ ux countries have announced the partial nation￭ alization of the banking group For￭ tis for 1￭ 1 ￭.￭ 2 billion Euro (￭ 1￭ 6 ￭.￭ 3 billion U ￭.￭ S ￭. ￭) ￭.
The intervention of the governments of Belgium ￭, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank B￭ NP Par￭ i￭ bas has indicated that it would ren￭ ounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion Euro (￭ 2 ￭.￭ 9 billion U ￭.￭ S ￭. ￭) in the risky mortgages crisis in the United States ￭.
For￭ tis employs 8￭ 5 0￭ 0￭ 0 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insu￭ rers ￭.
In return ￭, we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence ￭.
Meanwhile ￭, across the Channel ￭, the British government seems about to nation￭ alize another bank hit by the financial crisis ￭.
According to the English press ￭, the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Brad￭ ford and B￭ ing￭ ley ￭, including more than 4￭ 1 billion (￭ 7￭ 5 ￭.￭ 5 billion U ￭.￭ S ￭. ￭) in real estate loans ￭.
The Spanish bank S￭ ant￭ ander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank ￭.
L￭ ess mon￭ um￭ ental than Br￭ and￭ o ￭, who he resemb￭ led and was a long time sort of rival on the screen ￭, more cautious in his game ￭, certainly more fragile ￭, but also an a￭ post￭ le of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions ￭.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ran￭ ked second in the 2￭ 4 H￭ ours Le M￭ ans in 1￭ 9￭ 7￭ 9 ￭, doubled as a sex symbol ￭, albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1￭ 9￭ 5￭ 8 with the act￭ ress Jo￭ an￭ ne Wo￭ od￭ ward ￭.
His R￭ ach￭ el ￭, R￭ ach￭ el ￭, in 1￭ 9￭ 6￭ 8 (￭ based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Lau￭ rence ￭) ￭, with his wife Jo￭ an￭ ne Wo￭ od￭ ward in the lead role ￭, drew a fine female por￭ trait of mel￭ ancho￭ ly ￭.
New￭ man ￭, rather than sit on his myth ￭, has remained committed until the end ￭.
He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place ￭, and based on this in￭ voice they prepared the invo￭ ices to be submitted to the tenders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and S￭ ports ￭, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Mun￭ icip￭ ality of Budapest ￭.
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 1￭ 3￭ 0 gu￭ ests in a 3 ￭-￭ room pension in B￭ ad￭ ac￭ s￭ ony￭ tom￭ a￭ j ￭, which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people ￭.
The imagin￭ ative f￭ ill￭ ers of the invo￭ ices went also too far when they indicated P￭ ig￭ al K￭ ft ￭. in the documents ￭. It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations J￭ ob￭ b Jö￭ v￭ ő￭ ér￭ t and Hop￭ p￭ á ￭.
And he added that ￭, moreover ￭, the in￭ voice had been issued for the accommodation of 1￭ 0￭ 0 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 1￭ 1 rooms ￭, which did not have the capacity for so many people ￭.
The enthusiastic bill ￭-￭ makers were not aware of the fact that the Budapest ￭-￭ based travel agency that they selected organiz￭ es foreign tours only ￭, thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coincide with the in￭ voice issuing practice of the firm ￭.
Furthermore ￭, - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exempt from VAT ￭.
The degree of VAT ￭, which has been shown in four documents issued by H￭ ot￭ el R￭ év￭ f￭ ü￭ l￭ ö￭ p K￭ ft ￭. to the foundation J￭ ob￭ b Jö￭ v￭ ő￭ ér￭ t ￭, was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 1￭ 5 ￭% ￭, instead of the indicated 2￭ 5 ￭% ￭. Addi￭ tionally ￭, the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine ￭-￭ made invo￭ ices ￭, while the reviewed bills were manu￭ ally prepared ￭.
The in￭ voice ￭-￭ issu￭ ers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure ￭. This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting ￭.
The other group of the in￭ voice ￭-￭ issu￭ ers consists of those having been aware of issuing fic￭ ti￭ tious invo￭ ices ￭.
The foundation E￭ sé￭ ly Bud￭ ap￭ est￭ ér￭ t Al￭ ap￭ í￭ t￭ v￭ án￭ y issued an in￭ voice of about four million for￭ ints for on the request of Fi￭ at￭ al Bal￭ ol￭ dal - I￭ f￭ j￭ ú Sz￭ oci￭ alis￭ t￭ á￭ k ￭. This in￭ voice was issued to the foundation E￭ gy￭ ü￭ t￭ t a Har￭ ma￭ di￭ k É￭ ve￭ z￭ re￭ dér￭ t ￭.
Bi￭ og￭ ate K￭ ft ￭. - which is currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Z￭ us￭ ch￭ lag and his compani￭ ons ￭. In 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 3 the company provided the foundation J￭ ob￭ b Jö￭ v￭ ő￭ ér￭ t Al￭ ap￭ í￭ t￭ v￭ án￭ y ￭, the associations At￭ las￭ z E￭ gy￭ es￭ ü￭ let and V￭ ör￭ ö￭ s￭ fen￭ y￭ ő E￭ gy￭ es￭ ü￭ let with invo￭ ices of roughly H￭ U￭ F 5 million with no real economic activity behind ￭.
There was no cash flow either since the issued invo￭ ices were vo￭ ided later ￭, but the organizations for￭ got to indicate this in their documents ￭.
The executive director of the above ￭-￭ mentioned company was a Romanian man ￭, to whom Iv￭ án Ku￭ bat￭ ov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 2 and 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 5 ￭.
F￭ a ￭-￭ Ban￭ i J￭ os F￭ ai￭ pari K￭ ft ￭. and J￭ os ￭-￭ Investment B￭ t ￭. were founded by Romanian mas￭ ons ￭, specifically at the request of Iv￭ án Ku￭ bat￭ ov ￭.
Still ￭, he could take advantage of these undertakings ￭; for his request ￭, att￭ or￭ ney Z￭ sol￭ t Sz￭ ente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invo￭ ices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Z￭ us￭ ch￭ lag ￭, namely for At￭ las￭ z and Y ￭-￭ Gener￭ á￭ ci￭ ó ￭.
Ku￭ bat￭ ov provided 1￭ 5 invo￭ ices for the organizations in the name of C￭ ash Investment ￭, Del￭ ta Tri￭ ó ￭, F￭ a ￭-￭ Ban￭ i J￭ os ￭, J￭ os Investment and Lin￭ ax￭ trade ￭, with a total value of H￭ U￭ F 1￭ 4 ￭.￭ 2 million ￭.
According to the prosecution ￭, 1￭ 0 ￭% of the amount indicated on the invo￭ ices and the amount of VAT was the share of Ku￭ bat￭ ov ￭.
His testimony so far is not very detailed ￭, and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case ￭, he has not done so ￭.
A group of volunteers was playing lot￭ tery and another group was taking part in an auc￭ tion ￭. In the meanwhile ￭, the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic reson￭ ance imag￭ ing (￭ f￭ M￭ R￭ I ￭) ￭.
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auc￭ tion game - in which over￭ bi￭ dding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called stri￭ atu￭ m ￭, situated under the cere￭ br￭ al cor￭ tex ￭, was coming into operation upon the person ￭'￭ s defeat ￭.
In order to justify their theory ￭, the economist members of the research group conducted financial resear￭ ches as well ￭.
Pro￭ ving the hypo￭ thesis of the neuro￭ log￭ ists ￭, the members of the group "￭ playing for not losing money ￭" were ready to make higher bi￭ ds than the control group or the group "￭ playing for gaining money ￭" ￭.
Ap￭ proxim￭ ately half a billion people suffer from chronic h￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis B or C infection ￭. In Hungary ￭, the chronic li￭ ver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mortality ￭.
Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by h￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis can reach 1￭ 0￭ 0 0￭ 0￭ 0 ￭, only 7 0￭ 0￭ 0 of them are treated properly ￭. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected ￭.
H￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis vir￭ uses are transmitted in two main forms ￭, depending on the type of the pa￭ tho￭ gens ￭: h￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis A and E travel through the aliment￭ ary tr￭ act (￭ for example with infected food or water ￭) ￭, h￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis B ￭, C ￭, D and the other vir￭ uses are carried in blood and body flu￭ ids (￭ sem￭ en ￭, vag￭ inal m￭ uc￭ us ￭, sal￭ iv￭ a ￭) ￭.
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against vir￭ uses A and B by vaccination ￭; but there is no vaccination against virus C ￭.
Annu￭ ally and worldwide ￭, 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease ￭, h￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis B ￭, causing li￭ ver cancer and cir￭ r￭ ho￭ sis of the li￭ ver ￭.
H￭ ep￭ ati￭ tis C can also lead to serious problems ￭: it may result in cir￭ r￭ ho￭ sis of the li￭ ver or li￭ ver cancer if it is not treated ￭.
In case of early recognition ￭, the disease can be cu￭ red ￭, the virus can be destroyed ￭, thus infec￭ tivity ce￭ ases and the in￭ duction of cancer can be prevented ￭.
At the end of this week ￭, the Belgian ￭, the Luxembourg and the Dutch governments consulted on this issue at the highest level ￭, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission ￭.
For￭ tis shares started to plun￭ ge deeply last week ￭, then in the second part of the week signs of a serious crisis appeared at the company ￭.
No panic has emerged so far among the customers of the bank ￭; no bank rush has taken place ￭.

According to a recent research ￭, religious belief can be used as a kind of pain k￭ iller ￭, which could have e￭ ased the death of catholi￭ c marty￭ rs as well ￭.
Due to the brain scann￭ ing technology ￭, it turned out that the Catholic￭ s were able to activ￭ ate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation ￭.
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two pain￭ tings ￭; S￭ as￭ so￭ fer￭ ra￭ to ￭'￭ s Virg￭ in M￭ ary from the 1￭ 7￭ th century and Leonardo da Vinci ￭'￭ s Lad￭ y with an Er￭ mine from the 1￭ 5￭ th century ￭.
According to psych￭ olog￭ ist Miguel F￭ ari￭ as ￭, taking part in the experiment himself ￭, similar effect could be produced by any kind of pain￭ ting having strong emotional influence on the certain person ￭, even among a￭ the￭ ists ￭. It is all about finding the right picture ￭.
"￭ Pr￭ acti￭ sing faith should change and often does change our personality ￭" ￭, he added ￭.
On its 1￭ 0￭ th birth￭ day Google can admit ￭: it is there in the people ￭'￭ s po￭ cket ￭, as well as above their head ￭, in the sky ￭. Google knows where people go on vac￭ ation ￭, what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in ￭.
Eri￭ c Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users ￭. It is necessary to maintain the Google found￭ ers ￭' original aim ￭, namely ￭: "￭ to create a system for all the information of the world ￭" ￭, he added ￭.
An￭ sw￭ ering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like "￭ What shall I do tomorrow ￭? ￭" , or "￭ What type of jobs suit me best ￭? ￭" ￭. However ￭, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient ￭.
Using the 2 ￭-￭ year ￭-￭ old Pers￭ on￭ alized S￭ earch function ￭, users can store their own sur￭ f￭ ing histori￭ es ￭, they can review what they were looking for ￭, what kind of links they clic￭ ked on before ￭. In the long term ￭, it can provide the users with person￭ alized findings ￭. The function called Recommend￭ ations will be based on the same logic ￭: it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier ￭.
The best example for that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophi￭ les ￭; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social net￭ working pages ￭, called Or￭ k￭ ut ￭. The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophi￭ les ￭.
The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EE￭ F electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the FBI ￭: the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the FBI oblige Google to provide any kind of ￭, secret￭ ly asked information ￭.
(￭ Nevertheless ￭, - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 5￭ 0 0￭ 0￭ 0 web addresses and 1 0￭ 0￭ 0 search terms ￭. However ￭, it could not acquire the individual users ￭' search lists ￭, nor a complete list of web pages and key￭ words covering a two ￭-￭ month period ￭. ￭)
Meanwhile ￭, the American ge￭ ek culture and its wild o￭ at including enthusiastic computer fans ￭, activists ￭, users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies ￭, a "￭ co￭ ol corporation ￭" ￭, in contrast to their opinion about their rival ￭, Microsoft ￭, the cre￭ ator of W￭ in￭ do￭ ws and the conqu￭ er￭ or of the world ￭, in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal ￭.
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications ￭. Furthermore ￭, the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant ￭'￭ s practice - looks more available ￭, you￭ thful and co￭ ol ￭.
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or X￭ ang￭ a ￭, they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list ma￭ ker last ￭.￭ f￭ m ￭, then those can be connected to a tracking system such as Fri￭ end￭ Fe￭ ed or B￭ lip ￭.￭ f￭ m ￭. In addition ￭, users can create blo￭ gs that automatically update the recently u￭ plo￭ aded photo g￭ aller￭ ies stored on F￭ lic￭ k￭ r or P￭ ic￭ asa ￭.
We can read about several stories like this ￭: the girl - checking the plenty of photos u￭ plo￭ aded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her un￭ trust￭ worthy boy￭ friend spent his previous night ￭. Or another one ￭: an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blo￭ g ￭. One consequence can be definitely drawn ￭: the definition of privacy has been re￭ valued ￭.
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to byp￭ ass Google ￭'￭ s monopoly ￭, it is also possible (￭ e ￭.￭ g ￭. using S￭ cro￭ og￭ le ￭, which also applies the Google search system but pur￭ pos￭ ely leaves no trace behind ￭) ￭.
The number of those intenti￭ onally not regis￭ tering to social net￭ working sites is significant ￭. This way they can avoid being discovered ￭, Google ￭'￭ s online applications from text ed￭ itor to image manag￭ er and new￭ s￭ read￭ er can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge serv￭ er par￭ ks and not trying to create our best profile ever ￭.
The company - with its value of USD 1￭ 5￭ 6 billion - is worth more than I￭ B￭ M (￭ USD 1￭ 4￭ 0 billion ￭) ￭, In￭ tel (￭ USD 1￭ 2￭ 4 billion ￭) or Coc￭ a ￭-￭ Co￭ la (￭ USD 1￭ 1￭ 0 billion ￭) ￭. In addition ￭, the advertising spaces of Ad￭ Wor￭ ds ￭/￭ Ad￭ S￭ ense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever ￭-￭ increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software develop￭ ers a serious head￭ ache ￭.
Nevertheless ￭, critics can also find the disturbing counter￭ points ￭: the management completely rejected the employees ￭' objection ￭, which burst out because the fee of the company ￭'￭ s kin￭ der￭ gar￭ ten had been doubled ￭. The daily can￭ teen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management ￭. However ￭, all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google b￭ owed before the Chinese government in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 6 and - according to their agreement - the company has fil￭ tered all search results that off￭ end good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime ￭.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be adver￭ tised in advance ￭, only when they are ready to be used ￭. Still ￭, the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world ￭: some people predict that the book and magazine scann￭ ing and arch￭ iving project of Google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the Supreme Court ￭. Others have fear of the Health system ￭, which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us ￭, including our previous medical findings ￭, physi￭ cians and problems ￭.
Finally ￭, the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sc￭ i ￭-￭ fi writ￭ ers of the next generation ￭. C￭ ory Doc￭ tor￭ ow ￭'￭ s popular novel ￭, S￭ cro￭ og￭ led applies Or￭ well ￭'￭ s style in the description of a future where a person can be pic￭ tured terri￭ f￭ y￭ ingly well only by using Google data ￭.
"￭ The police interrog￭ ated two minors about the double hom￭ icide committed in Ó￭ z￭ d ￭. There are reasonable grounds for suspec￭ ting that they assisted the murde￭ rer in hiding the traces of the crime ￭" ￭, says the spokesman of the main police station of Bor￭ so￭ d Coun￭ ty ￭.
During the investigation ￭, it turned out that the 2￭ 3 ￭-￭ year ￭-￭ old young man owed significant amount of money to a 5￭ 3 ￭-￭ year ￭-￭ old man ￭.
The Warsaw Sto￭ ck Exchange submitted a bid to buy the Prague Sto￭ ck Exchange
Lud￭ wi￭ k S￭ ob￭ ol￭ ew￭ ski ￭, President of the Warsaw Sto￭ ck Exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the Polish ￭, in spite of the fact that the Czech had previously excluded the Warsaw Sto￭ ck Exchange from the group of potential owners of the Prague shares ￭.
9￭ 9 percent of the stakes are in the ownership of the Polish government ￭, which plans to sell 6￭ 0 percent of the papers during the next few months ￭.
On the basis of the information provided by the Czech newspapers ￭, offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange Nas￭ da￭ q ￭, the New York Sto￭ ck Exchange ￭, the London Sto￭ ck Exchange and the Deutsche Bö￭ r￭ se ￭.
Pet￭ r K￭ ob￭ lic ￭, director of the Prague Sto￭ ck Exchange declared last week that - among those being interested in the Prague shares - the worst option was the Warsaw Sto￭ ck Exchange ￭, the selection of which would result the cessation of the Prague bourse ￭.
The largest amount of shares is in the hand of the owner of the Patri￭ a Finance investment bank ￭, having approximately 2￭ 5 percent of the stakes ￭. It is followed by the C￭ es￭ ká S￭ por￭ it￭ el￭ na bank with 1￭ 4 ￭.￭ 7 percent and Tig￭ er Hol￭ ding Four S ￭. a ￭.￭ r ￭.￭ l ￭. with 1￭ 3 ￭.￭ 5 percent ￭.
It is not so much a new P￭ ear￭ l Harb￭ or ￭, as War￭ ren Bu￭ ff￭ ett bil￭ li￭ on￭ aire investor described it ￭, but rather a second September 1￭ 1￭ th ￭.
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse ￭, which will make the whole world suffer ￭.

"￭ The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 1￭ 0￭ 0 billion euros ￭" ￭, recalls the Vienna ￭-￭ based D￭ er Stand￭ ard ￭, adding that the worries are getting to point out that ￭, just like the Americans ￭, the European taxpayers will also have to di￭ g down into their pockets in order to remedy the situation ￭.
The compound structure of bees ￭' eye plays a significant role ￭, which makes the bees able to see in all directions ￭, at an angle of 3￭ 0￭ 0 degrees ￭.
"￭ If that was not so ￭, then the car robo￭ t would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles ￭, ￭" says To￭ shi￭ yu￭ ki An￭ do￭ h ￭, manag￭ er of N￭ iss￭ an ￭'￭ s Mob￭ ility L￭ abor￭ atory and principal engine￭ er of the robo￭ t car project ￭.
It must react instinc￭ tively and inst￭ antly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner ￭-￭ most layer of the safety shield ￭, a layer in which a crash is currently considered unavoidable ￭.
The whole process must mir￭ ror what a bee does to avoid other bees ￭.
But unlike a bee ￭, it cannot devi￭ ate up￭ wards or down￭ wards or di￭ ag￭ onally ￭, only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the whe￭ els can turn ￭.
So in place of the infin￭ ite number of ways a bu￭ m￭ ble￭ bee can avoid other bees ￭, here only the rotation function ￭, the acceleration and the dec￭ el￭ eration have been applied as available means of collision avoidance ￭.

The written version of the bill on the 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up ￭. The draft law ￭, applicable in several instal￭ ments ￭, aims to purchase bad banking loans ￭.
Re￭ fer￭ ring to the results of the compromise ￭, Henry Paul￭ son ￭, Secretary of the Treasury declared ￭: the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient ￭, but further steps are still to be taken ￭. According to P￭ elo￭ si ￭, it is not about rescu￭ ing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy ￭.
The written form of the package has been published at 8 p￭ m on Sunday ￭, Washington time ￭, at the opening time of the Asian markets (￭ at 2 am in Central ￭-￭ Europe ￭) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market ￭.
Now in the first round a maximum of 5￭ 0 percent of the USD 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion can be used in a way that USD 2￭ 5￭ 0 billion shall inst￭ antly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday ￭. One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage ￭-￭ backed securities ￭. An additional amount of USD 1￭ 0￭ 0 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used ￭.
Henry Paul￭ son declared ￭: pursuant to the law ￭, the required assets are provided depending on the situation ￭; it might be an aid of USD 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion urgently needed by the American financial system ￭, due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets ￭, or the insurance of those ￭, or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes ￭.
It must be added that the existing golden par￭ ac￭ hu￭ te contracts will not be amended ￭, restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme ￭.
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years ￭, which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector ￭.
"￭ This is not what American citizens expect from us ￭, this will not protect taxpayers ￭' dollars ￭" ￭, stated Republican Representative Dar￭ rell Is￭ sa from California ￭.

In August 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 the biggest price increase was experienced in le￭ ather ￭, foot￭ wear manufacturing industry (￭ 2 ￭.￭ 8 percent ￭) ￭, due especially to the 4 ￭.￭ 6 percent price increase in ba￭ g and str￭ ap production as well as the 2 ￭.￭ 5 percent monthly price increase in foot￭ wear production ￭.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials are responsible for a significant monthly growth in the prices of the production of chemical materials and products (￭ 1 ￭.￭ 6 percent ￭) ￭.

The prices in electricity ￭, gas ￭, ste￭ am and water supply playing a significant role in the domestic industrial sales ￭, rose by 0 ￭.￭ 3 percent ￭, due mainly to the widely influencing gas price increase ￭, which had been introduced by the authorities on 1￭ st July ￭.

N￭ ancy P￭ elo￭ si ￭, chair￭ woman of the House of Representatives provided the information that the House of Representatives was expected to vote on the bill on Monday ￭.
The defeat did not really surprise CSU but a whole process ended on Sunday ￭, a process that had been likely to happen in the last 1￭ 0 years ￭: the cessation of the indispu￭ table hegemony of a state party ￭.
The right wing is un￭ touched ￭, only the voters of the group have become more self ￭-￭ conscious ￭, critical and wil￭ ful ￭.
What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks ￭, mainly classical civil groups were depar￭ ting from CSU ￭; people of the liberal professions ￭, industrial workers ￭, people with secondary school certificate ￭, people with college or university degree ￭.
The election has already taken place ￭, now everything is about the coalition ￭; during the debate organized by the public television ￭, there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders ￭' cards ￭.
Whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party ￭, this issue has definitely to be discussed within Ö￭ V￭ P ￭.
The European Equality Summit has been opened today in Paris ￭, which is organized by France this year ￭, representing the Presidency ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ office of the European Union ￭.
In her message that she addressed to the plen￭ um ￭, L￭ í￭ via J￭ ár￭ ó￭ ka of Fid￭ es￭ z ￭, Representative of the European People ￭'￭ s Party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children ￭. Moreover ￭, this is the largest barrier to their prosperity ￭.
The high level conference has been opened by X￭ avier Ber￭ tr￭ and ￭, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and Vladimir Sp￭ id￭ la ￭, European Commissioner responsible for Employment ￭, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities ￭.
Representatives of the governments ￭, the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference ￭.
"￭ Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification ￭, and due to the low quality of the basic education only an insignificant part of them can obtain college or university degree ￭" ￭.
J￭ ár￭ ó￭ ka also emphasized that education ￭, as a fundamental human right ￭, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights ￭.
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school ￭, the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market ￭; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget ￭.
"￭ On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union ￭, the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality ￭, segreg￭ ated education must be eliminated ￭" ￭, added L￭ í￭ via J￭ ár￭ ó￭ ka ￭.
She also said that in order to inst￭ antly accelerate the processes of school des￭ eg￭ reg￭ ation ￭, it is necessary to guarantee an objective ￭- and action ￭-￭ oriented cooperation within the European Union ￭. To accomplish this goal ￭, it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti ￭-￭ discrimination directives ￭.
"￭ The vicious circle of poverty ￭, segregation ￭, unemployment must be eliminated ￭, Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights ￭" ￭, demanded J￭ ár￭ ó￭ ka ￭.
Within the framework of the "￭ European Year of Equal Opportunities ￭" ￭, the European Equality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti ￭-￭ discrimination at European and member state level as well ￭.
The American life and health insurance companies often refuse to sell insurance to some citizens ￭, due to their drug purchase data ￭.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market becomes un￭ control￭ lable ￭.
"￭ There is a data protection programme that requires the permission of the person concerned in order to use the drug prescription data ￭.
Insurance companies decide on the insurance fee and the amount to be paid in case of damages depending on the health condition of the applying customer ￭, and if they consider it too risky ￭, they do not provide insurance ￭.
D￭ ick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago ￭: on the basis of the customer ￭'￭ s identification number the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 1￭ 8 months can be easily detected ￭, thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condition ￭.
For instance ￭, the case of regularly buying big doses of chol￭ ester￭ ol ￭-￭ reducing drugs practically refers to the fact that the customer has un￭ treat￭ ably high blood fat level ￭, as a result of which this person would immediately be put to a higher risk category ￭.
The programme has various versions in trade ￭, some of them even defines the risk factor ￭, thus the insurance company has nothing else to do but the paper￭ work ￭, though smaller difficulties arise ￭.
More and more companies gain access to the data and ￭, in parallel ￭, the control of their use become increasingly difficult ￭.
There is a specific act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care providers and insurance companies ￭.
It is another question ￭, though ￭, that the applicant cannot really refuse consent ￭, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude contract with them ￭.
Five years ago the Christian Social Union - true ￭, lead by Ed￭ mun￭ d Sto￭ i￭ ber who had been at the top of his career at that time - had obtained 6￭ 0 ￭.￭ 7 percent but now ￭, one year after the coup against Sto￭ i￭ ber ￭, the party could reach 4￭ 3 ￭.￭ 4 percent only ￭.
Sto￭ i￭ ber ￭, who was staying in the background until now ￭, will have an active role in the transition time ￭, the ex ￭-￭ state prime minister and former CSU president claimed 2￭ 8￭ th September the d￭ ark￭ est day of his political career ￭.
After the Bundestag Election due in September 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 9 ￭, Merkel cannot be ch￭ ancellor ￭, unless CSU ￭, which was playing significant role in the 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 5 national success ￭, is re￭ habil￭ itated through mutual efforts ￭.
Although the 1￭ 0￭ 0 member legislation of the country of 1￭ 0 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade ￭, before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (￭ U￭ DF ￭) had seriously expected that Lukashenko ￭, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 6 after the amendments of the constitution ￭, was going to "￭ allow ￭" presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time ￭.
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russia ￭-￭ dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Bel￭ trans￭ gas ow￭ ning gas pipelines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU ￭, where visa is not granted for Lukashenko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belarusian political system ￭, which is considered anti ￭-￭ democratic ￭.
However ￭, O￭ ES￭ C ￭'￭ s Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes ￭.
According to the opposition ￭, improvement is still perceptible in the political system ￭: political prisoners have been dis￭ charged and Minsk is inclined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia which have sec￭ eded from Georgia ￭, although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month ￭.
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 6 ￭, this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the "￭ power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight ￭" ￭.
"￭ We have much trouble with this of course ￭, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia ￭, distribution is hindered by the local authorities ￭, but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people ￭, amongst the old ￭, too ￭" ￭, said Mil￭ ink￭ ev￭ ich referring to the fact that Lukashenko ￭'￭ s regime ￭, which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result ￭, is considered inappropriate even by pensioners who are officially most supported class of society of all ￭.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as Rot￭ ating President of the Union ￭, Committee President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Man￭ mo￭ han Sing￭ h and agreed to double ￭, i ￭.￭ e ￭. increase to more than 1￭ 0￭ 0 billion euros ￭, the trade flow in 5 years ￭.
Since exchange of goods raised from 2￭ 5 billion to 5￭ 5 billion between 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 and 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 7 ￭, this is not an overly ambitious objective ￭.
The goal is to find the balance while India is number one trade partner of the EU ￭, at the same time New Delhi has only the n￭ inth place on the list of EU partners ￭.
India agreed with this as well as with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate conference which is due next year and to decrease greenhouse gas emission by 5￭ 0 percent until 2￭ 0￭ 5￭ 0 ￭.

But as from today ￭, a new measure starts against cra￭ fty sk￭ i￭ vers ￭, against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours ￭.
"￭ The revol￭ ving doors – says Brun￭ etta – are a tool for working better ￭, with a higher productivity ￭, higher presence and more services ￭" specifies the minister ￭.
And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient ￭.
In particular ￭, at the T￭ AR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for in￭ firm￭ ity incurred during work will be contested ￭; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits ￭, and other aspects within the new provisions insisted on by the minister ￭.

It is necessary ￭, in our opinion ￭, - underlined Mer￭ c￭ and￭ elli – to have more controls and inspections ￭, but also a stronger intervention on the worker training ￭, and this should start at school ￭" ￭.
Mer￭ c￭ and￭ elli then denounced "￭ the progressive deterioration of the level of care benefit provided for casualties at work ￭" and the "￭ welfare drift which the system is taking in the last few years ￭" ￭.
"￭ Hence ￭, the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontan￭ eous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislators ￭" ￭.
"￭ It worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musi￭ cal players and cell￭ ular phones at very high volume may un￭ consci￭ ously damage their hearing in an irre￭ par￭ able way ￭" ￭, declar￭ es M￭ eg￭ l￭ ena Kuneva ￭.
Currently ￭, a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musi￭ cal players to 1￭ 0￭ 0 d￭ B ￭, but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources ￭, are increasing ￭.
Once the project has been concluded in March ￭, the Mun￭ icip￭ al Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects ￭, so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stamp of the Cam￭ pi￭ dog￭ li￭ o and the mayor Gi￭ anni A￭ lem￭ ann￭ o ￭.
"￭ The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions ￭, social ￭, and cultural are represented – underlines A￭ lem￭ ann￭ o – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political executives ￭, which are always the Mun￭ icip￭ al Board and Council ￭, can rely ￭.
There is no super￭ position of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up ￭.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless ￭, since its opinions will not be binding ￭, A￭ lem￭ ann￭ o replies ￭: "￭ Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals ￭.
If the quality is there ￭, as in France with the At￭ tal￭ i Commission and as I ￭'￭ m sure there will be in Rome ￭, then its contribution will be fundamental ￭.
Too often politics are overwhel￭ med by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time ￭.
On the contrary ￭, we want to look further forwards and further ahead ￭, with a deeper perspective ￭, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future ￭.
Furthermore ￭, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "￭ this commission is neither a useless agency nor an un￭ wiel￭ dy bureaucratic organisation ￭: it ￭'￭ s absolutely free ￭, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer ￭" ￭.
A future that ￭, specifies the Mayor of Rome "￭ will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further a￭ field ￭" not only with the view of a future met￭ ro￭ politan city and its legal status as Capital but "￭ also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean ￭" ￭.
In reality ￭, these are attacks that don ￭'￭ t mean a lot ￭: they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the elec￭ tors ￭' question ￭: will he be a good president ￭? And then there are the polls ￭; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin ￭.
A M￭ iss￭ issi￭ ppi newspaper ￭, deep in the South of the United States ￭, wrote an ed￭ itorial ￭: once inside the voting cab￭ in we know well enough to whom the American patri￭ ot will give his vote ￭.
USA ￭, the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists ￭: in the newspapers it is time for cuts ￭. And many blame the internet ￭, "￭ k￭ iller ￭" of the printed paper ￭.
The problem for American journalists is the money ￭, the money ￭.
The 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model ￭.
The biggest ri￭ ft in American journ￭ alism nowadays is between those who manage the new￭ s￭ rooms – that is the directors – and the report￭ ers who work for them ￭.
5￭ 6 ￭% of managers at national level are certain that their report￭ ers share their values ￭, whilst at local level the percentage decreas￭ es to 2￭ 3 ￭% ￭.
As for holiday ￭, things get complicated ￭: so many days the first year ￭, so many days after the third to get to a total of 1￭ 5 days after a certain number of years ￭.
The president of the second penal section of the Rome tribunal ￭, Carm￭ el￭ o R￭ in￭ au￭ do ￭, has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent ￭, Dan￭ il￭ o Cop￭ po￭ la that had requested to be able to move from his home town ￭, Gro￭ t￭ ta￭ fer￭ rat￭ a ￭, to an ab￭ ode in Rome ￭.
Cop￭ po￭ la is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter ￭-￭ proposal regarding the Uni￭ pol ￭-￭ B￭ n￭ l takeover ￭.
The phenomenon had already manifes￭ ted itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Representatives against the rescue plan of 7￭ 0￭ 0 billion American dollars passed by the White House ￭: a significant portion of Americans was ￭, and still is ￭, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy ￭.
A confirmation was given by yesterday ￭'￭ s New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republican Party ￭, ever more divided between its old East Co￭ ast soul ￭, moderate ￭, in favour of federal institutions and the business community ￭, and its new soul ￭, instead conservative ￭, hostile to ￭"￭ those in Washington ￭» and to the financial world ￭, especially strong within the Central and Southern states ￭.
The latter is but only one example of the changes ￭, of the big changes ￭, that the current economic earthquake perhaps her￭ al￭ ds or allows to be perceived ￭: not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here ￭.
The crisis ￭, in fact ￭, is a crisis for the financial ￭-￭ banking institutions who have ￭, indeed ￭, strong ties with foreign countries ￭, but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation ￭, in a single state ￭.
Political internation￭ alism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say ￭: the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that ￭, divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies ￭, cannot decide on a common political path ￭.
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention ￭, bailout and re ￭-￭ launching plans ￭, new rules ￭, and especially financial aid ￭: since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources ￭, the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things ￭.
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the stat￭ al ￭-￭ national element is after all perfectly tun￭ ed with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribu￭ te to a co￭ efficient that is very closely connected to that element ￭: territori￭ ality ￭.
Paradox￭ ically ￭, in fact ￭, while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web ￭, of a technology increasingly more sophisticated ￭, of the im￭ material ￭, while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world ￭, we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little im￭ material such as water ￭, har￭ ves￭ ts ￭, oil ￭.
In other words ￭, the call for leadership feeds under￭ han￭ de￭ dly a bran￭ ched but powerful movement of dele￭ gi￭ timi￭ zation of the manag￭ erial class and of the traditional political structures ￭, that manifest itself in the sudden electoral ￭"￭ revol￭ ts ￭» or ab￭ rupt tw￭ ists in the collective mo￭ ods in these last and latest times ￭, from the conservative rise in Austria – Bav￭ aria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain ￭, to the re￭ bellion of the American cong￭ ress￭ men against Bush (￭ and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it ￭) ￭.
One gets the impression that the traditional elite ￭, their parties ￭, their programmes ￭, but also their r￭ ites ￭, their newspapers ￭, their accred￭ ited intellectuals ￭, some would say their form￭ ats ￭, are finding it always more difficult to compreh￭ end ￭, and hence to represent ￭, that which has been taking shape within the deepest lay￭ ers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening ￭, aug￭ men￭ ting ￭, potentially ag￭ itating without restraint ￭.
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass ￭, Te￭ fl￭ on ￭, and s￭ and￭ paper have demonstrated that the new ad￭ he￭ sive is ten times stronger than the pa￭ ws of this rep￭ tile and at the same time ￭"￭ comes off from walls easier ￭» explains Lim￭ ing D￭ ai ￭, resear￭ cher at the Eng￭ ine￭ ering Fac￭ ul￭ ty of the University of Dayton ￭.
Perhaps for wal￭ king on walls just like S￭ pi￭ der￭ man ￭? Maybe yes ￭, but the researchers are thinking of a less g￭ lam￭ orous use such as the connections between electrical devices ￭, because the carbon nano￭ tu￭ bes are conduc￭ tors of heat and of electrical current ￭.
Be careful of grap￭ e￭ fruit ju￭ ice ￭, orange ju￭ ice ￭, and ap￭ ple ju￭ ice ￭.
These drinks ￭, especially consumed in summer because they are thir￭ st qu￭ ench￭ ing and rich in vitam￭ ins ￭, if taken together with some lif￭ es￭ aving drugs may alter their absorption ￭, ampli￭ fying or diminishing ￭, depending on the case ￭, their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health ￭.
Con￭ fir￭ ming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit ju￭ ices whether they are pre ￭-￭ pack￭ aged or fresh with certain medicines is David B￭ ai￭ ley ￭, prof￭ essor at the university of Western On￭ tari￭ o in London ￭, who from the 2￭ 3￭ 6￭ th national meeting of the American Chem￭ ical Society underway in Ph￭ il￭ adel￭ p￭ hi￭ a laun￭ ches a new warning ￭: a glass of grap￭ e￭ fruit ju￭ ice ￭, orange ju￭ ice ￭, or ap￭ ple ju￭ ice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain lif￭ es￭ aving drugs ￭, nul￭ lif￭ ying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients ￭.
D￭ RU￭ G￭ S AT RI￭ S￭ K – The very same Italian Drug Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago ￭, aler￭ ting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers der￭ iving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is dr￭ un￭ k in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Di￭ az￭ ep￭ am or M￭ eth￭ ad￭ one ￭.
NO￭ T ON￭ L￭ Y GR￭ AP￭ EF￭ RU￭ IT J￭ U￭ I￭ CE – According to experts even orange ju￭ ice and ap￭ ple ju￭ ice contain substances that inhi￭ bit drugs ￭.
Therefore ￭, always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear ￭, do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chem￭ ist for clarifications ￭» emphasised the expert from the An￭ sa Agency ￭.
Today sees the release of O￭ pen￭ office ￭.￭ org 3 ￭.￭ 0 ￭, the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users ￭, from domestic to home users ￭, from professionals to public administration ￭, as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office ￭.
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunte￭ er develop￭ ers ￭, with S￭ UN Micro￭ system supervis￭ ing at their backs ￭, the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various nov￭ el￭ ties ￭: to the welcome screen and to a re￭ visited ￭, less S￭ part￭ an user inter￭ face ￭, are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Ma￭ c OS X operating system and support for the new format OD￭ F (￭ Open Doc￭ ument For￭ m￭ at ￭) 1 ￭.￭ 2 ￭, the latest IS￭ O version standard ￭.
Inte￭ resting are some functions specific to some mo￭ dules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of Pow￭ er￭ Point present￭ ations ￭, useful for example for sending them via em￭ ail ￭, or the possibility of importing a P￭ DF file into the graphic￭ s mo￭ dule ￭, maintaining the original appearance of the page ￭.
Coll￭ aboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved ￭: in the spre￭ ad￭ sheet application several users can operate simultaneously ￭, avoiding conflicts on the modifications ￭, in the word proc￭ essor ￭, each users is assigned a comm￭ enting colour to improve recognition during revision ￭.
The Italian version is available for down￭ load at the address h￭ tt￭ p ￭: ￭/ ￭/￭ it ￭.￭ op￭ en￭ office ￭.￭ org ￭/￭ down￭ load ￭/￭ 3 ￭.￭ 0 ￭.￭ 0 ￭/￭ down￭ load ￭3￭ 0￭ 0 ￭.￭ h￭ t￭ m￭ l and is added to the English version which has been available on mir￭ ror sites since Friday ￭.
And if the g￭ im￭ mick of free could be a driving force for the diffusion into houses ￭, it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools ￭.
Open Office is composed of five main mo￭ dules ￭: W￭ r￭ iter ￭, for on￭ screen typ￭ ing corresponding to Wor￭ d ￭; Cal￭ c ￭, the spre￭ ad￭ sheet application aiming at substitu￭ ting Ex￭ c￭ el ￭; Im￭ press ￭, for present￭ ations in em￭ ulation of Pow￭ er￭ point ￭; D￭ base ￭, as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that cons￭ ents working on databases ￭; D￭ raw ￭, is the graphic mo￭ dule ￭.
Con￭ fir￭ ming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation E￭ p￭ o is the French anti ￭-￭ doping agency ￭'￭ s chief ￭, Pierre B￭ ord￭ ry who informed the Associ￭ ated P￭ ress that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results ￭.
Is this transforming the ‘￭ Bel￭ pa￭ ese ￭' into a nation of rac￭ ists ￭? This is what is being questioned in a long article in the New York Times ￭, which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Ab￭ du￭ l William Gu￭ i￭ bre originally from Bur￭ k￭ ina F￭ as￭ o killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of bis￭ cu￭ its ￭.
This case proves what the New York Times calls the "￭ northern paradox ￭" ￭: the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is "￭ most integration and most work ￭" but also where there is "￭ the highest anti ￭-￭ immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League ￭" ￭.
The w￭ reck￭ age has been found on a plat￭ eau at 3￭ 0￭ 0￭ 0 metres al￭ titude ￭, in the Sierra N￭ ev￭ ada area of M￭ am￭ mo￭ th Lakes ￭, at the border between California and N￭ ev￭ ada ￭.
The American National Transport Safety Bureau (￭ N￭ T￭ S￭ B ￭) has reported that some hours after the wrec￭ k was spot￭ ted an investig￭ atory team was sent ￭, that has then identified the aircraft ￭: it is the B￭ ell￭ anca 8￭ K￭ CA￭ B ￭, which has been missing since 3￭ r￭ d September 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 7 ￭, when Fo￭ ss￭ ett took off from Y￭ er￭ ington in N￭ ev￭ ada for a three hour flight ￭.
Yesterday ￭, always in California ￭, not far from the border with N￭ ev￭ ada ￭, some personal effects belonging to Fo￭ ss￭ ett were found by a couple near their house in M￭ am￭ mo￭ th Lakes ￭.
So the publicity campaign that will accompany the de￭ but of the new vehicle will set off a new communication method which also includes a fu￭ tur￭ istic campaign of 3￭ D bill￭ boards ￭, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand ￭.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with a presentation of the car in stere￭ osc￭ op￭ ic vision ￭, and thanks to special gl￭ asses distributed in the neighbourhood of Cor￭ so Com￭ o it will be possible to see the new S￭ U￭ V in true size and 3￭ D format ￭.
Without any doubts ￭, Mer￭ ce￭ des ￭, through this advertis￭ ement ￭, is trying to introduce something new into the conventional field of automotive publicity ￭.
And the Ministry of the Interior at V￭ im￭ in￭ ale had in fact checked them all ￭: among those groups going to So￭ fia none was banned ￭, none had been forbidden to frequent a st￭ adi￭ um ￭.
But let us also talk about the wh￭ ist￭ ling to the M￭ am￭ eli an￭ them ￭: that is also not a crime in Bulgaria ￭, but ￭, if I ￭'￭ m allowed to say ￭, it is not good man￭ ners . ￭. ￭. ￭" ￭.
Looking at the details of the investigation ￭, one can see that in Milan ￭, for a bed ￭-￭ space in the Bri￭ an￭ za zone ￭, 4￭ 5￭ 0 Euro are required ￭; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 6￭ 5￭ 0 (￭ Black B￭ and zone ￭) ￭, to an average price of 8￭ 0￭ 0 (￭ L￭ ambi￭ ate zone ￭, U￭ d￭ ine and Fi￭ era ￭) ￭, and on to a maximum of 9￭ 0￭ 0 ￭(￭ Vic￭ tori￭ a zone ￭) ￭.
In B￭ olo￭ gna ￭, where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university ￭, 2￭ 5￭ 0 ￭/￭ 2￭ 8￭ 0 Euro are required for a bed ￭-￭ space in a double room ￭, and from 3￭ 7￭ 0 to 5￭ 0￭ 0 for a single ￭.
In Rome in the zone near the central universities (￭ San L￭ or￭ en￭ zo ￭, Pi￭ az￭ za B￭ olo￭ gna ￭) approximately 6￭ 0￭ 0 Euro is the asking price for a single room ￭, 4￭ 5￭ 0 Euro for a bed ￭-￭ space in a double room ￭.
Sav￭ ings are only possible by moving to the sub￭ urb￭ s ￭: 3￭ 0￭ 0 Euro for a bed ￭-￭ space and 4￭ 5￭ 0 for a single in areas such as Pren￭ estr￭ ina ￭, C￭ ent￭ oc￭ elle and similar places ￭.
In Naples 3￭ 0￭ 0 ￭/￭ 4￭ 5￭ 0 Euro are required for a bed ￭-￭ space ￭, for a single room one spends 4￭ 0￭ 0 to 6￭ 0￭ 0 Euro ￭, with the highest prices found in the Poli￭ clin￭ ic￭ o ￭, V￭ om￭ er￭ o ￭, and Coll￭ i A￭ min￭ ei areas ￭.
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms ￭, but they have a higher impact on the local economy ￭.
In cities where ren￭ ting to non ￭-￭ EU students is a more frequent phenomenon ￭, such as Per￭ u￭ gi￭ a ￭, there is a further anom￭ al￭ y ￭: the increase of about 2￭ 5 ￭/￭ 3￭ 0 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students ￭.
"￭ A city without cin￭ em￭ at￭ o￭ graphic thea￭ tres is a blind city ￭, it ￭'￭ s like a face without eyes ￭" ￭.
The sid￭ el￭ ining process of the cin￭ em￭ as ￭, with the birth in the out￭ sk￭ ir￭ ts of large multi ￭-￭ h￭ all thea￭ tres and the consequent death by consumption of the single ￭-￭ h￭ all thea￭ tres within the central areas of the city ￭, is one of those events that appears unavoidable and in￭ contro￭ ver￭ tible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime ￭.
F￭ requ￭ ently ￭, it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear ￭, ￭"￭ it is as if a friend is lost ￭, an acqua￭ int￭ ance with whom we have shared the way and many memories ￭» ￭, ob￭ serves the director of New Cin￭ ema Parad￭ ise ￭, the film that twenty years ago gave Tor￭ nat￭ ore the Os￭ car and the Grand Prize of the jury of C￭ annes ￭, and which narr￭ ated the po￭ em of a provincial h￭ all and the nostal￭ gi￭ a for a way of living the cin￭ ema which ￭, perhaps ￭, has been lost forever ￭.
The numbers provided by A￭ ne￭ c ￭, the main cin￭ ema ￭-￭ operators association ￭, speak clearly ￭: within the last five years 3￭ 1￭ 6 traditional style cin￭ em￭ as have closed shop ￭, and the ones to pay the price were above all the thea￭ tres in the principal cities ￭: 1￭ 0 less in Florence ￭, 9 in Milan ￭, Naples ￭, B￭ olo￭ gna ￭, and Rome ￭, 6 less in Turin ￭, 5 in Pal￭ er￭ mo ￭.
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multi￭ ple￭ x is the most responsible for their disappearance ￭, these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multi￭ ple￭ x cin￭ em￭ as registered ￭: 1￭ 9￭ 5 more scre￭ ens in L￭ omb￭ ar￭ dy in the last five years ￭, 8￭ 1 in both T￭ us￭ c￭ any and E￭ mili￭ a ￭-￭ Rom￭ agn￭ a ￭.
«￭ The Italian business has developed in an irrational way ￭» ob￭ serves Pa￭ olo Pro￭ t￭ ti ￭, A￭ ne￭ c ￭'￭ s president ￭, ￭"￭ it ￭'￭ s useful that new structures are built but it ￭'￭ s also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed ￭, because once a thea￭ tre in a city clo￭ ses ￭, not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multi￭ pl￭ exes ￭.
An interesting example is that of B￭ olo￭ gna ￭, the first Italian city that ￭, concerned by the closures ￭, has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municip￭ ality and A￭ ne￭ c ￭, the first of its kind in Italy ￭, to protect and promote single ￭-￭ h￭ all cin￭ em￭ as both in the historical centre as well as on the out￭ sk￭ ir￭ ts ￭.
«￭ It ￭'￭ s an initiative which I like ￭» ob￭ serves Gi￭ us￭ ep￭ pe Tor￭ nat￭ ore ￭" and hopes that other cities follow the example of B￭ olo￭ gna by putting in action other measures ￭.

The accusations that the magistr￭ ates of the Cal￭ ab￭ re￭ se Anti ￭-￭ mafia Office direct against the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gi￭ o￭ ia T￭ au￭ ro Gi￭ orgi￭ o D￭ al Tor￭ ri￭ one and Ros￭ ario Schi￭ av￭ one ￭, and the mayor of Ros￭ ar￭ no Car￭ lo Mart￭ elli ￭, who have been arrested this morning for external contest with mafia association ￭, are very serious ￭.
Also arrested is Gi￭ o￭ ac￭ chin￭ o Pi￭ rom￭ all￭ i ￭, the senior mediator between the cl￭ an and the public administration offices ￭, and his ne￭ p￭ he￭ w - a lawyer ￭, nam￭ es￭ ake of the bo￭ ss ￭, already condemned for mafia ￭-￭ style criminal association ￭, condemned to repay 1￭ 0 million euro ￭.
The president of the Cal￭ ab￭ re￭ se local council Ag￭ az￭ i￭ o L￭ oi￭ er￭ o does not hide that "￭ col￭ lu￭ sions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous ￭" within his region ￭: "￭ there are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others ￭, where collusion is almost inevitable ￭.
At the end of last April ￭, the municipal council of Gi￭ o￭ ia T￭ au￭ ro was dis￭ solved but already in 1￭ 9￭ 9￭ 1 ￭, and always for presum￭ ed condi￭ tioning between organised crime and local administration ￭, local politicians had been reli￭ eved from duties of administration of the municip￭ ality ￭.
He brought in cause the then vice ￭-￭ minister of the Interior Marco Min￭ nit￭ i acc￭ using him of having pl￭ ot￭ ted everything for political motives ￭, however the judges ￭, in the arrest warrant signed this morning ￭, have explained that the Pi￭ rom￭ all￭ i gang had even arrived at asking for the variation of the A ￭3 project ￭.
When the oil prices went down ￭, around 1￭ 9￭ 8￭ 0 ￭, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside ￭, but now the appeals by the environ￭ ment￭ alists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector ￭.
Two years on there are more companies bet￭ ting on marine energy and among these ￭, there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy ￭.
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U ￭.￭ S ￭. Energy Commission ￭, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Al￭ as￭ ka ￭.
Besides Ch￭ ev￭ ron there are Ver￭ dant Power In￭ c ￭. Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jer￭ sey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far ￭, even though they are not known in detail ￭, indicate according to the observers an increasing interest ￭.
Even though it is an inter￭ mit￭ tent phenomenon ￭, the tide is more predictable than the wind ￭, the sun ￭, or the waves ￭, and so is more reliable as a source of energy ￭.
It ￭'￭ s exactly on ti￭ dal energy that states such as New York ￭, M￭ aine ￭, and Al￭ as￭ ka ￭, together with others that overlook the coast ￭, have already invested 7 ￭.￭ 5 million dollars in 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 8 and are foreseen investments of up to 3￭ 5 million for 2￭ 0￭ 0￭ 9 ￭.
